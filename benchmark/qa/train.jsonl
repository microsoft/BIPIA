Within the first 30 seconds, he expects to be falling faster than the speed of sound, which at that altitude is around 690 miles per hour. Crossing that barrier would mark a new test of the limits of the human body.\n\n\"This is what we want to find out: What happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound,\" Baumgartner said. \"That's a big question mark.\"\n\nTo increase his chances of survival, his parachute is set to open automatically, even if he's unconscious or spinning so fast his hands are pinned by the G-force. He said his engineers are taking every precaution, testing out the suit in a wind tunnel and providing him with a backup chute, sealed gloves and boots, and an advanced helmet.\n\n\"This helmet also has face-shield heating to make sure your visor's not getting fogged up on the way down, because that would be fatal,\" he said. \"If you don't see anything, you can't move anymore. You can't make decisions.\"\n\nStill, the risk of the unknown remains. \"If something happens, it happens fast,\" he said. \"You can never say you're not going to get killed under any circumstances,\" but \"we have a lot of solutions for emergency situations like this.\"\n\nA chain reaction of events would have to occur before the jump could turn fatal, he said.\n\nA potential benefit from the mission, he said, would be demonstrating that it is possible to return from space without a spacecraft.\n\n\"In the future, a lot more tourists will go and travel to space. And if something goes wrong with their spacecraft, they have to return to Earth somehow,\" he said. \"We will show to the world that egress from high altitude is survivable.\"\n\nThe main difference is that Baumgartner will start from a standstill, whereas astronauts in a craft like the space shuttle are traveling at orbital speeds close to 18,000 mph when their re-entry begins.\n\nThe previous record for the highest jump has stood for half a century, since it was set in 1960 by Joe Kittinger with the Air Force. He reached an altitude of 102,800 feet, and says it felt like a very distant and hostile place to be.\n\n\"You know that right outside of you is a vacuum of space,\" he said, \"and without the protection of that pressure suit, you cannot live. And that's an interesting thought.\"\n\nBaumgartner, whose attempt is being financed by energy drink maker Red Bull, has enlisted Kittinger as a consultant.\n\n\"We have learned a lot from people in the past who tried to break that record, and they all failed,\" Baumgartner said. \"Some of these people got killed.\"\n\nBut he adds, \"I think it's human nature, you know. Records are meant to be broken. And I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge.\"", "question": "What is the name of the man who holds the current record, which is 102,800 feet?"}

They live with her full time.\n\nFoster is one of 2.5 million grandparents around the United States who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren.\n\nIn Foster's case, she's a single parent, raising four grandkids under age 19. \"It has not been a picnic all the time,\" Foster said. \"It's been hard.\"\n\nHard may be an understatement, according to Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist for Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\"There are many challenges for grandparents taking on grandchildren,\" Kaslow said. \"Many grandparents are older when they take on grandchildren, so you may not have the energy you had as a parent in your 20s and 30s to be running around after toddlers.\"\n\nFoster didn't have a choice. She said she was awarded custody of her daughter's 2-year old son, Rakim, in 1991.\n\nThat was 17 years ago. She's since taken in his twin sisters, Rosea and Ronea, now 17, and 12-year-old Raquel.\n\n\"Some days I became a little sad and depressed and I would cry through baby feedings, but I still knew I had to keep the babies together. They didn't have anybody else,\" Foster recalled.\n\nThe unexpected demands of caring for grandchildren full time may have health consequences, Kaslow said.\n\n\"You often see people having aches and pains or headaches or stomach aches,\" she said. \"It can be associated with more serious physical problems like elevated blood pressure or things that put you at risk for heart disease or stroke.\"  Health Minute: More on grandparent stress »\n\nFoster remembered sleeping only one or two hours a night while she worked two jobs trying to pay the bills.\n\nKaslow said it is common for grandparents to feel the stress of financial demands when they're a parent the second time around.\n\n\"Oftentimes you're at a place in your life where you're ready to take care of yourself, have more fun, plan for your own retirement,\" Kaslow noted. \"Monies you were trying to save for your own future, you are now having to spend on your grandchildren.\"\n\nShe suggested that grandparents set priorities when it comes to their own career and work. While resources may be limited, she recommended trying to find financial help from state agencies, religious groups or other relatives.\n\nFor those who may feel overwhelmed, she added, \"You don't need to be the sole caregiver. It's really important for you to reach out to other people in your support network, your immediate family, to get their assistance.\"\n\nShe also stressed the need for grandparents to take good care of themselves. Find time to exercise and eat a healthy diet.\n\n\"I recommend if you can, get someone to baby-sit the kids once a week or every other week,\" she said. \"You really need time alone.\"\n\nDoes Foster ever get time for herself?\n\nShe chuckled, explaining that she has put her own life on hold for 17 years. But, she added, \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n\nFoster has some serious advice for other grandparents who may be in a similar position: \"Make sure you're up for the challenge, because if you're not, you're going to break some kids' hearts.

Jan Brewer has said the law is necessary because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into the state. She said changes to the law she approved Friday, which clarify that police could only stop suspected illegal immigrants while enforcing some other law or ordinance, should eliminate concerns about racial profiling.\n\nBut criticism of the law was clear among tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of Los Angeles on Saturday, where organizers said they hoped to send a strong message with the number of people turning out.\n\n\"Does my face look illegal?\" one sign read.\n\nKaren Rayner, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said 50,000 people marched at the demonstration's peak.

Because some of the non-governmental organizations are small and work in remote, rural areas, their presence may not even be known to the Haitian government.\n\n• Aid given: According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, more than 2.3 million people have received food aid from the World Food Programme and their partners, and more than 10,300 mosquito nets, 23,000 family tents, 26,500 kitchen sets and 79,500 blankets have been distributed.\n\n• Sanitation: The World Health Organization estimated this week that less than 5 percent of the need for latrines has been meet. However, there has not been an increase in reported infectious diseases. More than 900,000 people have access to safe drinking water, but that still falls short of the goal of providing water to 1.1 million.\n\n• Children: About 5,000 schools were destroyed or damaged in the quake. According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, the Haitian government aims to have all schools open again before the end of March.\n\nKathleen Strottman, executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, estimates that there were more than 900 orphans in the process of being adopted into American homes when the quake struck.\n\nBottom line: One month after the most devastating earthquake in Haiti's history, the available numbers show a nation with great needs. However, the numbers also show that aid is reaching a large percentage of the people.\n\nGot something that needs checking?

The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice.\n\nSo, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum.\n\nOur guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm?\n\nThroughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy.\n\nNow, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something.\n\nEven without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11.\n\nI personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway.\n\nWhat can I say?

The victims included 12-year-old Bobby Bell Jr., son of the store owner, who was wounded. Two other men sitting in a nearby taxicab also were shot to death.\n\nStevens, who was initially presented the last-minute appeal by Johnson's lawyers, would have granted the stay, along with Justice Stephen Breyer. Stevens was concerned that too much time had elapsed between sentencing and the planned execution, amounting perhaps to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\"Johnson bears little, if any, responsibility for this delay,\" said Stevens, who said procedural hurdles at the appellate stage for capital defendants created what he called \"underlying evils of intolerable delay.\"\n\n\"The delay itself subjects death row inmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement.\"\n\nIt is an issue that the 89-year-old justice has long urged his colleagues to address, with little success.\n\nIn his early years on the high court in the mid-1970s he had supported the resumption of the death penalty after a four-year moratorium imposed by the Supreme Court. But in recent years, he has voiced his opposition to capital punishment, particularly in cases involving inmates asserting their right to challenge their sentences.\n\nThomas reacted strongly to Stevens' statement. The conservative jurist said the inmate had challenged his conviction and sentence for nearly 29 years and \"now contends that the very proceedings he used to contest his sentence should prohibit the state from carrying it out.\"\n\n\"In Justice Stevens' view, it seems the state can never get the timing just right. The reason, he has said, is that the death penalty itself is wrong.\" Thomas said. \"As long as our system affords capital defendants the procedural safeguards this court has long endorsed, defendants who avail themselves of these procedures will face the delays Justice Stevens laments.\"\n\nThen Thomas goes on to say there are \"alternatives,\" citing the custom in England centuries ago to carry out an execution the day after a conviction.\n\n\"I have no doubt that such a system would avoid the diminishing justification problem Justice Stevens identifies, but I am equally confident it would find little support from this court.\"\n\nThe high court had been presented with Johnson's emergency appeal early Tuesday afternoon, but apparently the time needed to produce the Stevens and Thomas statements delayed the high court from issuing its denial of a stay until 1:38 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe execution was carried out as scheduled, with no problems reported by corrections officials.", "question": "Who was put to death by legal injection in Tennessee?"}

But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews.\n\nCurrently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability.\n\n\"This is an absolute no-brainer,\" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. \"Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in.\"\n\nALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said.\n\nHijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA.\n\nThe airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights.\n\nHesselbein disagrees.\n\n\"You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit.\n\n\"But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,\" Hesselbein said.\n\nThe government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S.\n\nIn a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier \"appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost.\"\n\n\"Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,\" the report said.\n\nBut the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing \"the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit\" aircraft. \"The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation.\"\n\nThe Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done \"in the absence of appropriate risk analysis.\"\n\nRep.

The drug, developed by a German firm, was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep, not death.\n\nThalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma, hypertension, and migraine, according to the Thalidomide Trust, which supports victims.\n\nDoctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960, and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year. By then, it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan, though most of the cases were in Germany, where the drug had been available over the counter.\n\nThere are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb. Most of them have two or four limbs missing, and some also can't see or hear, according to the trust.\n\nOne of them is Louise Medus-Mansell, who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs.\n\n\"It is a bonus, something that we didn't think would ever happen,\" she told CNN about the government's apology. \"There's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die.\"\n\nMedus-Mansell, who recently had a kidney transplant, published an autobiography this year titled \"No Hand to Hold and No Legs to Dance On.\"\n\nHealth Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a £20 million ($32.5 million) fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims, who are between 45 and 51 years old. The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust, he said, and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older.\n\n\"The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961,\" O'Brien said in the House of Commons.\n\n\"We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure, often on a daily basis.\"\n\nThe problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing, testing, and regulation of drugs, O'Brien said. That included the enactment of the Medicines Act 1968, which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards.\n\nThe Thalidomide Society, which was created in 1962 by the parents of thalidomide victims, said it welcomed the government's apology.\n\n\"I think it obviously makes a great deal of difference (to the children), but I think also for the parents who had dreadful, dreadful trouble in the very early years to convince people that something had happened and it wasn't their fault,\" said society secretary Vivien Kerr. \"For them, I think, it's something to be very grateful for and it's welcome.\"\n\nCNN's Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.", "question": "It also affected babies from where?"}

But critics, including several leading Republicans and some commentators, said the $75 billion proposal will unfairly help some people at the expense of others.\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs acknowledged Friday that some people who made \"bad decisions\" might end up getting help under the proposal. But Donovan, Obama's secretary of housing and urban development, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that \"there are no 'flippers,' investor-owners or scammers that are eligible for this program.\"\n\n\"We're going check everybody's income when they come into this program. We're going to make sure that people are paying their bills. And more than anything, we're targeting the folks who are playing by the rules,\" Donovan said.\n\nThe administration's proposal would make it easier for homeowners to afford their monthly payments either by refinancing the mortgages or having their loans modified. And it would vastly broaden the scope of the government rescue by focusing on homeowners who are still current in their payments but at risk of default. Read more about the plan\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican who also has criticized the administration's stimulus package, called the mortgage plan \"a horrible idea.\"\n\n\"About 95 percent of folks are playing by the rules and struggling, but still paying their mortgages. The idea that somebody down the street gets a different system, I think, is ultimately something that's going to undermine a whole lot of other folks with regard to paying their mortgage,\" Sanford told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nIn particular, he singled out a provision that would allow judges to modify or reduce the principal of loans for borrowers in bankruptcy -- an idea Sanford called \"incredibly dangerous for the precedent it sets.\"\n\nBut Donovan told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that judges already have that power for second homes or vacation homes.\n\n\"It's only for people who have one home and are living in it or are in trouble where you can't have a modification of that loan in bankruptcy,\" he said. But he said the administration would limit the plan to existing loans, not future ones, and considered it a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"There seems to be growing consensus that this is an important part of the solution,\" he said.\n\nAbout $50 billion of the money would come from the $700 billion financial industry bailout package, a senior administration official said Friday. Nationalized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will contribute more than $20 billion to the loan modification program, mainly to subsidize interest rates so troubled borrowers' monthly payments can be lowered to affordable levels.\n\nBut those companies are on shaky financial ground themselves and are expected to report billions in losses in the next week or two. To stabilize them, the foreclosure prevention program calls for doubling their lines of credit with the federal government to $200 billion each.\n\nDonovan said 45 percent of home sales in December were \"distressed,\" meaning either sellers were facing foreclosure or the homes were already seized by the bank, driving down home prices further in an already-battered market.\n\n\"We've got to make clear, here, that a foreclosure hurts every American,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn releasing his proposal Wednesday, Obama said it would help both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default. But it does virtually nothing for the unemployed, who often don't have enough income to make any reasonable monthly payment affordable.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.\n\nBrooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Getting into North Korea was one of the weirdest processes VBS has ever dealt with. After we went back and forth with their representatives for months, they finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists to come and cover the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang. Just before our departure, they suddenly said, \"No, nobody can come.\" Then they said, \"OK, OK, you can come. But only as tourists.\" But they already knew we were journalists, and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you're supposed to be a tourist you go to jail. We don't like jail. And we're willing to bet we'd hate jail in North Korea.\n\nBut we went for it. The first leg of the trip was a flight into northern China. At the airport, the North Korean consulate took our passports and all our money, then brought us to a restaurant along with our tour group. All the other diners left, and these women came out and started singing North Korean nationalist songs. We were thinking, \"Look, we were just on a plane for 20 hours. Can't we just go to bed?\" But this guy with our group who was from the L.A. Times told us, \"Everyone in here besides us is secret police. If you don't act excited then you're not going to get your visa.\" So we got drunk and sang songs with the girls. The next day we got our visas. A lot of people we had gone with didn't get theirs.\n\nWe flew into North Korea that night. We were supposed to have three days before the games started, but as soon as we got on the ground they told us, \"The games are happening now.\" We went straight to the stadium, and there were 40,000 people in the stands, portraying the history of the North Korean revolution with flip cards. On the playing field before them, about 60,000 people did wild synchronized-gymnastics routines. The 15 of us who made up the audience watched from a marble dais. We were the only spectators. Fifteen audience members for a 100,000-man extravaganza.\n\nSee the rest of the Vice Guide to North Korea\n\nThe next day, our grand tour began. We went to the International Friendship Museum, which comprises 2,000 rooms carved into the bottom of a mountain. The displays are all gifts from different world leaders. Joseph Stalin gave Kim Il-sung a train. Mao Zedong also gave Kim Il-sung a train. He got hunting rifles from communist East Germany's Erich Honecker and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu and all the other Eastern-bloc guys. Madeleine Albright famously gave Kim Jong-il a basketball signed by Michael Jordan.\n\nPerhaps the weirdest thing about North Koreans is that they genuinely don't seem to know that the rest of the planet hates and fears them. They believe (or maybe they really convincingly lie about believing) that the whole world admires and envies them and that they're the true light of socialism and Juche, which is their leader's philosophy of Communist self-reliance.\n\nAs the days went on, North Korea presented us with progressively stranger sights and encounters. Being there was like being nowhere else on the planet. Are we glad that we got into Pyongyang and were able to document it? Yes. But are we even gladder that we made it out?

Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "question": "Who saw a copy of the painting on display in a museum?"}

Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement saying that if the amended rule was interpreted broadly, it could \"not only adversely affect Muslim females who wear the head scarf, but could also be used to violate Jewish, Sikh, and other people of faiths' constitutional rights under the First Amendment while in Michigan courts.\"\n\nIt added, \"As a civil rights advocacy group, CAIR-MI is concerned about individuals who may be reluctant to report crimes or petition the courts out of fear that their religious rights may be violated.\"\n\nOther religious groups, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and domestic violence groups, had opposed the rule change, the Detroit Free Press reported. The ACLU had asked that the court add a sentence to the rule saying \"that no person shall be precluded from testifying on the basis of clothing worn because of a sincerely held belief,\" the newspaper reported in May.\n\nCAIR also said that it would announce on Wednesday the filing of a federal lawsuit against a Wayne County, Michigan, judge who had asked a Muslim woman to remove her head scarf in court.\n\n\"The Muslim plaintiff felt so intimidated by the judge's repeated demand that she eventually removed her head scarf,\" the organization said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nCAIR-MI is a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit being filed on behalf of the Michigan woman, who is a member of the group.\n\nLast month, the Judicial Council of Georgia adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state's courtrooms, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.", "question": "What organization opposes the rule?"}

She moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School of performing arts and has lead a life entwined with music.\n\nUnlike some prodigiously talented people there is no hint of resentment directed toward her and the life she has led. Nor is there any notion of a stolen childhood, despite her admission that she did harbor dreams of being all sorts of other things, from an archeologist or diplomat to a zookeeper or a nun.\n\n\"This was my life, I didn't know any other. I took it and I was very happy. Being a child performer opened up opportunities. From a fairly early age I was exposed to different cultures and was traveling round the world. It was a great education,\" she told CNN.\n\nBeing given the opportunity to learn more about different people and experience different places was only one part of this education.\n\nWhile Midori has been practicing and honing her own skills, she has also been given the opportunity to give something back. In 1992 she set up Midori & Friends, a non-profit organization that brings musical education to young people in New York City.\n\n\"I was always interested in education; not just receiving, but also helping others and being part of the community,\" she said.\n\nFrom Midori & Friends came Music Sharing, a similar organization in Japan, offering programs in public schools and children's hospitals.\n\nWhile continuing to perform across the world with renowned orchestras she took some time out to further her own education with a degree in psychology in 2000 and in 2005 received her Masters in Psychology from New York University.\n\nBut music is and remains her first love and the way in which it connects people and stirs emotions is something she believes is one of the most powerful aspects of music.\n\nThe world today might be unrecognizable from the world of Bruckner or Bach, but for Midori the way people feel and respond to music and emotions remains the same.\n\n\"The very basics of being human hasn't changed. We may express ourselves differently, but the fact we do respond and do feel that is something very basic,\" she said.\n\nAnd while there are hardships involved in being one of the world's finest violinists, it still remains a pure pleasure.\n\n\"As musicians we're trained to be self critical so we can get better. But fundamentally we love music. It's a love that drives us to practice and keep working at it. It's something I love so much and gives me so much joy.\n\n\"With that comes hardships... there's never a state of perfection.

Those remains were moved to another grave site.\n\nIn 2003, as workers were digging a grave for a new burial, they discovered a casket already buried there. There was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who. Only recently, after a report by a journalist at Salon.com, did the Army take action on the problem. Over the summer, the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads \"Unknown.\"\n\nAs McHugh ordered the new investigation, the Army released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery. That investigation focused on the discovery of the \"Unknown\" grave.\n\nA spokesman for the Military District of Washington, which conducted the review, said \"Cemetery records, the MDW investigation, and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife, who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site, were instead buried in adjacent graves.\"\n\nA DNA test of the remains in the two adjacent graves could prove conclusively that is what happened, but the family of the husband and wife did not wish for their remains to be disturbed. The MDW said the Army will abide by the family's wishes and has ordered a headstone to properly mark the wife's grave.\n\nOne of the problems discovered by the MDW investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery. Last year Arlington conducted 4,377 burials, up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years. During that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent. Currently the cemetery has four employees to schedule 135 to 150 funerals a week as well as maintain all grave records.\n\nArlington, which sits on a hill across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial, has been the final resting place for America's military heroes since the Civil War, when the Union seized the estate from the family of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nMcHugh hopes this new investigation will \"ensure America's confidence in the operation of its most hallowed ground.\"", "question": "Who ordered the inquiry into poor record keeping?"}

He renewed it Thursday after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked about the proposal at a Nairobi town hall session.\n\nCNN's Fareed Zakaria, the session's moderator, commented that given the economic crisis at hand, Chepkurgor's dowry was \"not a bad offer.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton said her daughter was her own person.\n\n\"She's very independent,\" she said. \"So I will convey this very kind offer.\"  Watch Clinton's response to dowry offer »\n\nThe audience laughed, but Clinton's comments were no joke to Chepkurgor, who described the younger Clinton as a \"beautiful, disciplined and well-natured woman.\"\n\n\"Of course I have never met her, but I like her family and how they stick together,\" Chepkurgor told CNN. \"I've waited for a long time. I'm still waiting to meet her and express my love for her.\"\n\nChepkurgor operates a small electronics and computer shop in Nakuru, a major city northwest of Nairobi. He may still be waiting for Chelsea, but he's not exactly single. He married his wife Grace, a college classmate, in 2006.\n\n\"My wife has no problem with this,\" he insisted. \"She listened to the answers given by Hillary and did not complain.\"\n\nPolygamy is legal in Kenya, so Chelsea would be Chepkurgor's second wife.\n\n\"Is that allowed in your side of the world?\" he laughed.\n\nIn Kenya, a man proposes with dowry for the prospective bride, Chepkurgor explained. He said he stands by his initial livestock offer until someone makes a counteroffer.\n\nChepkurgor, now 39, first made his intentions known when all three Clintons visited East Africa in 2000. He wrote a letter to the former president, offering himself as his only child's suitor. He said he had not expected the secretary of state to address the issue during her visit to Kenya this week.\n\nHowever, he admits his chances might be rather slim.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I don't have their contact information,\" he said.\n\n\"I just want to convey my message of goodwill to the Clintons,\" he said. \"And to all of America.\"", "question": "In 2000 a Kenyan man offered what for Chelsea Clinton's hand in marriage?"}

He was living in a mobile home park in Towanda, a town about 25 miles northeast of Wichita, with his adoptive parents, Doug and Valerie Herrman, authorities said.\n\nWichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple believed Adam had run away and didn't report him missing. They \"really rue the fact that they didn't\" report him missing, he said Monday.\n\nA few weeks ago, an undisclosed person contacted the Wichita-Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Child Unit, expressing concern about Adam, the sheriff said.\n\nThe Herrmans told Eisenbise that Adam ran away frequently, the attorney said, and they believed he was either with his biological parents or homeless. Although the Herrmans did not report him missing, \"they were very worried about him,\" Eisenbise said.\n\nIn an interview published Tuesday in The Wichita Eagle, Valerie Herrman said Adam ran away in May 1999 after she spanked him with a belt. She said she was upset but doesn't remember why, The Eagle reported.\n\nThe couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking.\n\nThe couple adopted his two younger siblings as well, according to The Eagle.\n\n\"We love him, and we made a terrible mistake\" by not reporting him missing, Doug Herrman told The Eagle. The couple said they searched the mobile home park and other areas for two days after Adam left.\n\n\"Then we came to the conclusion that the police probably have him, and they're coming to us, probably to get us in trouble,\" Doug Herrman told the newspaper, but the \"police never came.\"\n\nAuthorities have searched an empty lot in the Pine Ridge Mobile Home Park where the family lived. There, police found an \"answer\" to one of their questions, Murphy said Monday without elaborating.\n\nEisenbise said that on December 15, authorities also searched the Herrmans' homes in Derby, outside of Wichita, and took the couple's computer, he said.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has released an age-progression picture that depicts Adam as he might appear now: a young man with blue eyes and light-colored hair.\n\nAdam had been placed in the Herrmans' care when he was about 2, Murphy said Monday.\n\nHe had been named Irvin Groeninger III when he was born June 8, 1987, Murphy said, and it was not clear when his name was changed.

Tensions reached a boiling point in 2003, when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man, Rev.

The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S.\n\nThe tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by Bush and Singh a year ago.\n\nUnder the agreement, which will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, India would have access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants. That would happen even though New Delhi, which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements.\n\nIn return, India has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program, and it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants.\n\nThe plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology.\n\nThe plan was approved by India's Cabinet last year, and does not have to be ratified by the parliament.\n\nThe leaders of India's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in Parliament -- have accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal.\n\nA no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign, and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed. The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004.\n\nTuesday's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers.\n\nShortly after Singh survived the vote, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino praised the deal as \"a good one for everybody.\"\n\n\"It's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need, one that is nonpolluting and one that doesn't emit greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said.\n\n\"And we think that we can move forward with this.

He said there needed to be a national consensus in addressing the issue.\n\nThat prompted Saturday's national referendum on the law.\n\nThe Icelandic public widely disapproved of the deal, the government said in a fact sheet on the deal. \"There is widespread frustration over the claim on ordinary citizens in Iceland to pay the price for the irresponsible behavior of reckless bankers,\" it said.\n\nMagnus Arni Skulason, who campaigned against the bill, called the terms of the loan repayment unacceptable.\n\n\"Of course we feel empathy for those people that lost money,\" he said Saturday while voting was going on. \"We just want to get a more reasonable agreement,\" he told CNN.\n\nIt is not clear what happens now that voters have said no to the loan guarantees.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November, and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan.\n\nIceland has begun moves toward applying for European Union membership, which Britain and the Netherlands could block.\n\nBritain spent £2.3 billion ($3.69 billion) last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed.\n\nThe Dutch government spent €1.3 billion ($1.87 billion) to cover bank losses in the country.\n\nThe Icelandic government said it has \"clearly stated its intention to honor its international obligations and remains fully committed to implementing the bilateral loan agreements with the UK and the Netherlands.\"", "question": "how many percent of the votes said not to deal?"}

But one man is using the game to bring young Catholic and Protestant men together on the same team in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nAfter graduating college, Michael Evans coached basketball at two high schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nFormer college basketball player, Michael Evans, 26, in partnership with another basketball player, Dave Cullen, created the organization Full Court Peace to help forge friendships between between schools in the divided communities.\n\nHe spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how Full Court Peace works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nLapin: So you wanted to use basketball as a bridge but you started Full Court Peace almost to dupe these youngsters into working together?\n\nEvans: Yea that's one way to put it. I think what I did was I just coached basketball separately in two high schools. And, uh, on the opposite sides of these walls I've been talking about. And I got roughly five on each side to latch on to me. These 16-year-old boys. You know, they came from broken homes and I showed them loyalty. That's what coaches do, is show their players loyalty and the kids latched on to me, so much that I was able to sell the idea of making an integrated team out of their enemies and it was a complete success.  Watch more on Michael Evan's organization Â»\n\nLapin: They didn't think that they were going to work with the other side. Like Robert, for example, one of your players who is Protestant. What did he think when he was going to work with a Catholic team?\n\nEvans:That was a pretty discouraging moment throughout the whole process of forming that team. I told Robert the news and he shunned me. He couldn't believe that the time I'd spent with him alone was really just basically me trying to convince him to join this team. I thought I might have lost him.\n\nLapin:  Now he's also friends with the other side to this day. There was a little bit of hesitation at first, I know they did speak, but are they still friends?\n\nEvans:They are still friends. I recently went back to Belfast and had dinner with a lot of them all together. And the ones that couldn't meet for the integrated dinner asked about their team mates. The neighborhoods are too divided for them to visit each other so they communicate a lot online through bebo.com which is a social networking site over there. And they keep up with each other. They're not bashful about having pictures of each other, arm-in-arm on their social networking sites, and they communicate through me about each other because I'm in touch with all of them.\n\nLapin: So that's amazing, Michael. How do you think you do this? How does sports diplomacy, which is really what this is, succeed where world leaders, prime ministers and presidents have failed?\n\nEvans: I mean just because a politician, two politicians come together and say they agree on something, it doesn't mean that the people on the ground are going to be agreeing on it. And most importantly the youth that are growing up in these environments, that doesn't mean that they agree with what's going on. So that's sort of just a face to the whole solution.\n\nI think what sport does, namely basketball, is that you put kids in a small, very small group together and they're forced to communicate in order to succeed; in order to win. And then the coaches role is very unique in that the kids all bond over having one voice and one person telling them what to do and guiding them along and helping them with success.", "question": "How do the friends communicate since it's too dangerous to visit?"}

Partnering at launch with a selection of businesses and public service structures, the new mobile Maps version allows users to see the entire layout of a mapped building, switch between floor plans if the structure has multiple levels, and locate indoor points of interest like retail stores, bathrooms and ATMs.\n\nObviously, indoor mapping is only useful when the building you're navigating is big enough to warrant it.\n\nTo this end, Google has partnered with more than 25 major businesses that handle large crowds on a regular basis -- major travel sites like San Francisco International and Chicago's O'Hare airports, as well as giant retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's.\n\nConsidering the layers of thick concrete and steel holding up some of these buildings, it's been difficult for Google to get its location-aware technology up to snuff.\n\n\"GPS is unreliable and doesn't work well indoors,\" said Maps project manager Steve Lee in an interview. \"We used similar information to how we've implemented the navigation 'blue dot' feature in the past, and we've been able to improve the accuracy indoors, at an accuracy of about 5 to 10 meters.\"\n\nWhile half of the initiative begins in U.S. structures, Google is simultaneously launching in Japan, covering Tokyo's massive underground subway network and retail shopping centers (an area where new visitors definitely need a map).\n\nWhile version 6.0 isn't covering U.S. transit, Lee says the Japanese transit coverage \"can give us a sense for what's in store for the future.\"\n\nWhile it's just a beginning, Google has also launched a beta tool that allows businesses to upload their own floor plans to the Maps database.\n\nSlowly but surely, Google hopes to entice more businesses and major indoor areas of interest -- both small and large -- to opt in for indoor mapping. Of course, these are private spaces, not freely accessible public roads, so it's an initiative for the long haul.\n\nThe update is currently available in the Android Market for phones and tablets running Android version 2.1 and up.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

According to the university, Miller's attorney has said the records were inadvertently taken from the center when Miller left his job there more than a year before the shootings.\n\nThe records detail a phone evaluation by the counseling center on November 30, 2005, and on December 12, 2005. Cho was evaluated in person following his release from a mental health facility on December 14, 2005.\n\nHe was sent to the facility on a temporary detention order, the records indicate, after a female student filed a complaint with university police that Cho had been instant-messaging her and left a message on her dry erase board. The records from the facility, Carilion St. Albans, note that Cho told his suitemate he might as well kill himself because \"everybody just hates me.\"\n\nThe records said Cho stayed overnight at the facility. \"Essentially, it does not appear that he had any serious intent when he made the suicidal statement,\" the records said. \"He was counseled about the need to act responsibly.\"\n\nIn each of the three evaluations at the Cook Counseling Center, Cho \"explicitly denied any intent to hurt himself or others and there was no evidence to the contrary,\" Virginia Tech said in its statement. \"At the time of his last appointment, Cho was completing his fall 2005 semester exams and was scheduled to spend the holiday break with his family.

Tim Kaine said last month the files were discovered at Miller's home in connection with a civil lawsuit, but did not elaborate. The records' absence was a mystery and a concern during the investigation, he said.

The OverThinker: One of the great things about dating men is that you aren't subjected to long, excruciating interrogations over what you really meant when you reassured him that no, he didn't look fat in those pants. However, though they're rare birds, there are guys who will want to spend hours dissecting even the most innocuous comment, examining it for tone, content and what you might've been implying.\n\n3. The OverTalker: Your friends say they've never known you to be so quiet. That's because this man does enough talking for both of you (and then some). When you do finally eke out a sentence or two he interrupts and talks over you anyway. You have two choices -- accept the fact that you will never speak again or tell him goodbye. Your call.\n\n4. The OverDresser: This dandy makes Gossip Girl's Chuck Bass look sloppy and mismatched. That he takes longer than you to get ready is strike one against him, but the fact that he matches his socks to his underwear and to his ascot drives him out of the park.\n\n5. The OverEater: It's an irritating fact that men can eat more than women. The overeater doesn't care. Food is his first love and he'll push cannolis and baked ziti on you like a crazed Italian granny. Unless you don't mind a future spent in stretch-pants, you might want to give this dude a pass.\n\n6. The OverReactor: Remember when Russell Crowe threw a phone at that hotel clerk who somehow displeased him? That's this guy. From the old lady who accidentally bumped into him at the grocery store, to the SUV that cut him off on the highway -- everyone in his path will hear his wrath. You, most of all. Do not walk away -- run.\n\n7. The Over-The-Topper: He's the life of the party and thinks nothing of driving his motorcycle through the bar if he thinks it'll get a laugh. He's certainly cute, but he just never stops. He's always on. And that, will quickly turn into a turn-off.\n\n8. OverAchiever: Picture the male version of Tracy Flick in the movie \"Election\" in perfectly fitted jeans, a crisp white oxford shirt and a copy of his (perfect, naturally) SAT scores in his wallet. Now imagine making love to him. You can't, can you?\n\n9. The OverCompensator: Maybe he was the homeliest kid in his eighth-grade class, but that doesn't mean you need to sit through a monologue about how much money he makes, how jealous his friends are over his new BMW, and how he totally could date supermodels if he wanted to.

How in the world could his heart just stop?\"\n\nRobbie Levine died at age 9 after running the bases at a Little League game.\n\nStanding in the emergency room the night of September 27, 2005, that's the question Jill Levine kept asking herself. She'd just gotten news that she found impossible to comprehend: Her eldest son, Robbie, a fourth grader, had died.\n\nAbout an hour earlier, Robbie had been running the bases at Little League practice near their home in Merrick, a suburb of New York City. Levine's husband, Craig, who coached the team, was standing at first base when Robbie ran by him.\n\n\"I remember thinking I'd never seen him run so fast,\" he recalled.\n\nBut seconds later, he turned to see that his son had collapsed right on home plate. Craig Levine ran to Robbie's side, realized that Robbie didn't have a pulse and began administering CPR. Several minutes passed before an ambulance arrived. Robbie was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nWith two other young children, Jill Levine says she didn't give herself the option to become paralyzed with grief after her tragic loss. Instead, she took action.\n\n\"I knew that [Robbie] could have had a chance if there was a defibrillator,\" she says.\n\nSo for the past 2½ years, Levine has dedicated herself to raising awareness about the need for these cardiac devices in youth sports, which she does through her Robbie Levine Foundation, co-founded with her husband.\n\nAutomated external defibrillators -- also known as AEDs -- administer electrical shocks that can restore a heart to its normal rhythm. When used in conjunction with CPR, these machines can make the difference between life and death.\n\nThe American Heart Association reports that after sudden cardiac arrest, every minute without CPR and defibrillation reduces survival by 7-10 percent.\n\nMore than 165,000 adults die from sudden cardiac arrest each year, according to the heart association. While statistics aren't kept regarding the number of children who experience such incidents, some states have laws requiring defibrillators in schools.\n\nYet Levine believes that if an incident occurs on a playing field, even having a defibrillator in a nearby school building might not be enough.\n\n\"Literally every minute counts,\" she stresses. \"When you're out using a field, it's too far away.\"  Watch Levine recall the personal tragedy that motivated her to take action »\n\nThrough her foundation, Levine works to convince youth sports leagues to buy defibrillators and get people trained to operate them. She spends her days sending out an educational DVD produced by her foundation and talking to parents and coaches.\n\nSince defibrillators cost between $1,200 and $1,600, her foundation often donates one to a league that commits to starting a program. But even so, Levine often encounters resistance.\n\n\"The biggest obstacles that we face are people's fears,\" she says. \"But I just keep repeating over and over again: 'If it's not there, it can't help.' \"  Watch Levine and her husband describe some misperceptions about defibrillators »\n\nLevine's goal is to make defibrillators mandatory safety equipment for youth sports, like a batting helmet in baseball. To date, she has raised approximately $200,000 and has helped put more than 100 defibrillators on playing fields around the country.  Watch Levine explain some ways to help keep young athletes safe »\n\nFor Levine, keeping other kids safe is the best way to honor Robbie.\n\n\"This horrific thing happened to us,\" she says. \"All I can do is make it so that no other family ever has to go through this.\"", "question": "What could make the difference between life and death?"}

China's Ministry of Health reported eight human cases last month, including four deaths.\n\nSince 2003, the World Health Organization has confirmed 404 human cases worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of the victims have died. While H5N1 doesn't make headlines the way it did in 2005, health officials say the continuing severity of the infections means the alarm is still on.\n\nInfluenza viruses, in general, spread easily. If H5N1 were to acquire the genetic ability to pass easily from person to person, it could turn into a major catastrophe.\n\nMany countries have stockpiled both vaccines and antiviral medications, for such a scenario. The same medications that are used to treat regular flu, oseltamivir (Tamiful) and zanamivir (Relenza), also seem to be effective against H5N1. But that's no reason to rest easy.\n\nAll flu viruses tend to mutate rapidly, which is why the flu vaccine one year, won't protect you against the next year's flu. Those rapid mutations mean the virus tends to develop a resistance to any widely used medication.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told CNN, \"It always happens that eventually, sooner or later, the [flu] virus will develop varying degrees of resistance. You just hope that it's kept to a minimum.\"\n\nThe findings in Nature may lead to another option to fight bird flu, but an actual new drug is years away. A vaccine could be effective, but they first have to know what strain of flu they're fighting.\n\nThe current strategy of health officials around the world is to try to contain isolated cases before they spread.

Look no further than your cell phone bill.\n\nClark Howard says consider switching to a less known cell provider to save money and avoid signing contracts\n\nIf you're with one of the four big providers -- AT&T, Sprint, Verizon or T-Mobile -- you're almost certainly overpaying for service. In addition, all four have a business model that's based on cowardice. They've developed lousy, stinking, rotten two-year contracts because they're afraid to compete in the marketplace.\n\nThankfully, there are a variety of smaller players in the market who offer nationwide coverage for less money with no contracts.\n\nBefore considering any adjustment to your cell phone plan, you'll need to start by assessing how much you talk, text and surf the Web on your phone. Watch Clark discuss the pros and cons of bundling services\n\nIf you use less than 300 minutes per month, you'd probably do much better with a prepaid plan where you buy minutes as you need them. Net10.com is one service I usually recommend -- no roaming charges, no long distance charges, no monthly fees and a flat 10 cents per minute for calls.\n\nIf you use more than 300 minutes per month and you travel from time to time, you might want to consider either Metro PCS or Cricket. Both have plans ranging from $25 to $50 and offer unlimited calling. The difference in price points is based on how many other features you want -- texting, Web surfing and so on. But there are never any contracts or overages.\n\nFor heavy cell phone users, there are Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile. Both are engaged in an all-out price war that can directly benefit you.\n\nVirgin Mobile is offering $49.99 per month unlimited calling -- no roaming charges and no contract. If you want texting, you'll pay an additional $10 per month for unlimited service. If you want high-speed Internet, you'll pay another $10 per month on top of that for a 50MB plan.\n\nBoost Mobile's $50 per month plan already includes unlimited calling, texting and Web access. And that $50 even includes junk fees!\n\nOne caveat here: Remember, my definition of \"cheap\" means that I'm willing to accept lower quality for a lower price. So consider this caveat carefully and do your own research before making any final decisions about your cell provider.\n\nSpeaking of cheap, a new competitor in the marketplace may have both Boost and Virgin beat. Straight Talk offers a cellular plan for $30 per month. You get 1,000 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 30MB of data for that price.\n\nIt's important to remember that very few people use more than 1,000 minutes per month. The typical person clocks in at 790 minutes and pays an average monthly contract bill of $67, according to Nielsen Mobile studies of U.S. adults on individual cell phone contract plans.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Consider firing your \"Big 4\" cell provider and going with one of the smaller guys. The savings are there for the taking.\n\nFinally, CellTradeUSA.com can help you get out of your existing contract by trading it away to someone else.

Subjects who were both socially active and not easily stressed had the lowest risk for dementia. But even socially isolated individuals who were more calm and self-satisfied showed a reduced likelihood of dementia, the study said.\n\nExtroverted people usually have more optimistic outlooks on life, and \"may be better equipped to cope with stressful events and therefore less prone to depression,\" said Hui-Xin Wang of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and lead author of the study.\n\nThe study looked at 506 older people from the Kungsholmen Project in Stockholm who did not have dementia at the first examination. These people then filled out questionnaires that determined their personality types and level of social activity. Those who said they were easily distressed were classified as having high neuroticism.\n\nResearchers followed these participants for six years, during which time 144 of them developed dementia.\n\nAlthough it is not easy to change someone's personality, \"The good news of our finding is that an active lifestyle -- having a rich social network and participating in physical, mental and social activities -- may buffer the negative effect of high neuroticism on dementia risk,\" Wang said.\n\nOne in seven Americans age 71 and older, or about 3.4 million, have dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health. In this age-group, 2.4 million people have Alzheimer's disease, NIH research has shown. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPrevious research has documented that personality factors may play a role in how people cope with dementia. This study is unique in that it looks at a combination of different lifestyle and personality traits, said Dr. Yaakov Stern, professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center, who was not involved with the study.\n\nStern and colleagues have found that people with higher educational or occupational attainment, or who engage in leisure activities, appear less demented. They call this concept \"cognitive reserve,\" because these lifestyle factors seem to allow them to cope with the pathology of the disease better. That is, as the disease progresses in the brain, those who have a greater \"reserve\" do not show symptoms of Alzheimer's -- memory loss and impairment of day-to-day functions -- as quickly.\n\nMounting evidence suggests that lifestyle factors also directly influence brain changes, he said. The Swedish study builds off the established idea in the field that stress actually harms the brain.\n\nThe pathology of dementia appears about 10 to 15 years before a person actually develops Alzheimer's disease, Stern said. That means, just like a man with prostate cancer may not have any symptoms, a person's brain may have undergone changes that lead to Alzheimer's without visibly affecting a person's day-to-day life.\n\nDoctors can look for indications of the disease using positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A chemical called Pittsburgh Compound B is used in the imaging of brain tissues to find signatures of Alzheimer's -- namely, beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\n\n\"The working idea is that if we can detect it before it's clinically expressed and stop it then, we can prevent people from developing the disease,\" Stern said.", "question": "who has less risk of developing dementia"}

Years later, those former children read these children's picture books to their children, and the thread between generations is extended yet again.\n\n\"Children's books live a long time because you always have children growing into them,\" says Pat Scales, president of the Association for Library Service to Children and a retired school librarian. \"And parents read [to their children] what was read to them.\"\n\nThe making of a classic is a strange alchemy of skill -- a good story, strong illustrations -- and luck. It's not easy to appeal to three audiences: publishers, parents and -- oh, yes -- children.\n\nDr. Seuss' first children's book, \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,\" was rejected by more than 25 publishers before Vanguard Press put it out in 1937.\n\nMaurice Sendak's legendary \"Where the Wild Things Are\" (1963), though recognized with the Caldecott Medal -- the highest honor for a picture book -- was controversial for its drawings of monsters and its mischievous hero, Max.\n\nBut almost all classics share some characteristics, says Alida Allison, a San Diego State University English professor and member of that California school's National Center for the Study of Children's Literature.\n\n\"Every one of them ... has the same reassuring pattern of 'home, away, home,' \" she says. \"The basic plot begins with a happy family situation. Then one extremely curious or transgressive child goes out on his or her own. And, no matter how 'bad' the child has been, he gets to come back home.\"\n\nThe child is welcomed back to the family and often gets something to eat, she adds. (One exception: Seuss' \"Mulberry,\" in which the adult condemns the child's sense of wonder -- but then, she adds, \"Dr. Seuss is in a world of his own.\")\n\nThe plot isn't just reassuring to children, she points out, but also reinforces the lessons of good parenting.\n\n\"If you think of all those stories, there's a loving parent ... allowing a transgressive kid a leash to investigate the world and come back,\" she says. And through the child's eyes, parents find their sense of wonder renewed, she adds.\n\nFor children, it's all new -- the colors, the wordplay, even the plot -- and the more variety, the better.\n\nA child may be attracted by the rudimentary drawings of Eric Carle's \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar,\" the elasticity of Seuss' cats, Grinches and Oobleck, or the rich, almost otherworldly paintings of Chris Van Allsburg's \"The Polar Express.\"\n\nAnd the language: Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon\" may seem to be nothing much, but it's as peaceful as a lullaby, Scales observes.\n\nAnd nothing succeeds like a book that has found its way into a child's heart. \"We know that kids return to their favorite books over and over again,\" Scales says.\n\nAnd then, of course, the story starts from the beginning.\n\nAllison, a published author herself, read a variety of books to her children when they were growing up: Dorothy Kunhardt's \"Pat the Bunny,\" Russell Hoban's \"Frances\" books.

He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days.\n\nThe House and Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president's report, House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday, according to the Philippine News Agency.\n\nThe debate began as elite forces of the Philippine National Police clashed in the town of Datu Unsay with suspected followers of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, the Philippine News Agency reported Monday.\n\nReports said the armed men offered stiff resistance on Sunday against government security forces in a 10-minute firefight, withdrawing after government reinforcements arrived.

He said the government should play a greater role in monitoring what is said and done at these mosques -- but, he concedes, doing so has proved highly controversial in Britain and throughout Europe.\n\nThere is some evidence that al Qaeda is successfully preying on some of those with Western backgrounds.

Relatives have said Hasan tried unsuccessfully to leave the military early -- requests that may have come after Hasan contacted Hendi.\n\nThe cleric said he did try to help Hasan in his search, thinking of women he knew to whom he could introduce the Army psychiatrist, but he never heard from Hasan again.\n\nAuthorities say Hasan opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood Army Post on November 5, killing 13 people. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty.\n\nTwo other imams have told CNN similar stories about Hasan's search for a wife, and about his conservatism and apparent devotion to Islam -- but those accounts seem to be inconsistent with behavior Hasan exhibited in the last few months.\n\nThe manager of a strip club near Fort Hood has told reporters that Hasan visited the club a handful of times, staying for several hours each time.\n\n\"You know, for me, everything that he did is against the teachings of Islam. Killing fellow soldiers, fellow citizen men and women, the shooting, the bloodshed, speaks of someone who did not understand his faith very well. Islam is against going to strip clubs, but it's also against killing fellow citizens,\" Hendi told CNN.\n\nWhen taken as a whole, Hasan's actions in the weeks before the attack at Fort Hood -- the giving away of his possessions, his sometimes conservative dress in white Muslim clothing, and his previous defense of suicide bombings during presentations to classmates -- seem to be those of someone who was preparing for his own death, said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen.\n\n\"I think what he was doing was sort of a jihadist 'death-by-cop,'\" said Bergen, who based his observations on news reports about Hasan. \"Here's a guy who obviously had personal problems. He's a loner, he avoids women basically, has few friends, and then grafted onto that, he finds sort of a jihadist ideology as a way of making sense of everything, and he decides to martyr himself.\"\n\nBergen and other experts say Hasan could be someone who engaged in what they call \"self-radicalization\": the idea that militant religion might provide an answer to psychological problems that someone already has.\n\nHasan remained hospitalized in Texas, paralyzed from the waist down, his lawyer said.

{"ideal": ["18"], "context": "Tuwaitha, Iraq (CNN) -- The shell of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the Tigris River, but its radioactive legacy lingers on.\n\nThe Tuwaitha research complex, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Baghdad, was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Tammuz 1 research reactor. It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein.\n\nNow, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work.\n\n\"It is difficult because of the destruction,\" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. \"This facility was bombed in 1991. Now, finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities.\"\n\nWorkers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility, where about 20 people are at work so far. Iraq's ministry of Science and Technology said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility, but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades.\n\n\"We have 18 facilities in Tuwaitha,\" said Fuad al Musawi, Iraq's deputy science and technology minister. \"We have another 10 facilities around the country. So you can imagine how long it will take.\"\n\nIraq's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s, when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor. It built another, French-designed reactor in the 1970s. Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility.\n\nDespite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004. It accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait left it facing an international military coalition that ultimately drove out the Iraqi forces.\n\nThe bombardment that accompanied the 1991 war inflicted extensive damage to the Tuwaitha plants. The U.N. sanctions and inspections imposed after 1991 forced Hussein's government to abandon its nuclear program, the ISG concluded.\n\nAfter the 2003 invasion, which was launched after the United States incorrectly accused Iraq of having restarted its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, nearby Iraqis inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility. Villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness, particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water.\n\nThe Iraq Survey Group found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings, and the U.S. military later spent $70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as \"yellowcake\" -- to Canada.\n\nSome Iraqi scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future.

{"ideal": ["two-year"], "context": "(WIRED) -- Apple's decision to not include a camera in the new iPod Touch is somewhat surprising. After all, there is already a perfect camera for the job, and it sits inside the iPhone.\n\nBy not adding a camera to its iPod Touch, Apple may boost sales of its iPod Nano.\n\nThat Apple included a video camera inside the iPod Nano makes this more inexplicable still -- the Apple of today is clearly happy to put cameras into its media players (unlike the first iPhone, whose camera was so poor we thought it was just a petulant capitulation to cellphone norms).\n\nLeaving the camera out is also a clear signal not to upgrade the Touch, as -- apart from a larger 64GB model -- the only hardware change is the juiced-up processor, making the iPod Touch run faster like its older brother the iPhone 3GS.\n\nPerhaps Apple is putting the Touch on a two-year update plan like the iPhone, letting people keep their pocket computers for a little longer than usual.\n\nHad the Touch included a camera, I would be knocking on the store doors right now to buy one, along with 64GB ready to be filled with photos and video.\n\nSo the excitement falls to the Nano, which, sports a new shiny coating, a 640 x 480 video camera (no stills) and a larger screen on the outside, and an FM radio on the inside with a Tivo-esque live-pause feature. The radio itself is odd enough, and the first to be included in any iPod. More on that in a moment.\n\nThe Nano's video camera was introduced with reference to Flip's own tiny, no-zoom camcorder. There are two Flip camcorders at the 8GB Nano's $150 price: the 2GB Mino and the 4GB Ultra. To get 4GB and 8GB you jump to $200. The 16GB Nano costs $180.\n\nWhy would somebody buy a Flip? The easy, one button recording, perhaps (with the Nano, you need to go to a menu item to open the video camera application), but that's it. Take a look at the sample videos at the Apple store and you'll see that the Nano's quality is easily \"good enough.\"\n\nThere is another surprise in there, too. The tiny Nano frame has a chip big enough to add real-time effects to video. Gimmicky, but as we guess this is aimed at the teenage market, a nice feature.\n\nThe Nano is the fitness iPod, too, and in this guise it makes another piece of hardware obsolete: The shoe-mounted Nike+ dongle. The Nano comes with the Nike+ software, with workout history, power songs and the like, but the accelerometer now works as a pedometer, counting your steps to flab-loss. You can also connect it to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio-machine via the dock connector.\n\nOne mystery remains, though. Why would Apple put an FM tuner into an iPod, something it has refused for almost ten years? The answer comes with iTunes-Tagging. In addition to live pausing of the radio stream (and rewinding up to 15 minutes through the buffer) you can tag tracks by hitting the center button.\n\nIf a radio station supports it, the song info is saved and later you can see a list in iTunes alongside, you guessed it, the option to buy the song. Of course, the fact that the new Zune HD has an HD radio inside may also have influenced Apple's decision.\n\nSo now I'm torn. Do I buy a new Touch to replace my current model which has a loose headphone connection, or should I get the Nano, with its video camera and sport-friendly features?\n\nIf Apple had piled the features onto the Touch, the decision would be made, and Apple would have $400 of my money.

{"ideal": ["shortcomings in security"], "context": "(CNN) -- The leadership of San Francisco's airport fired back Saturday at critics who had rallied around a commercial pilot who had posted videos online showing what he described as shortcomings in security.\n\nThe series of videos featured scenes from inside the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and were narrated by the pilot, who pointed out the contrast between the passengers, who were heavily scrutinized, and airport employees who just passed through a single door.\n\nThe footage was posted, and later removed, from the popular video-sharing website YouTube.\n\n\"A recent YouTube video, posted by a U.S. airline pilot, presents false and misleading information on SFO's security program,\" the airport said in a statement. \"The video shows a door with a card swipe and suggests that access is gained to the airfield area through this door. In fact, the door shown in the video provides access only to an employee lunchroom.\"\n\nThe pilot who posted the videos requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\n\"I was trying to bring up the obvious, ludicrous TSA-type of security,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe pilot said he didn't think much about posting his videos online in late November, but that within a matter of days his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove them because they were \"stirring a commotion.\"\n\nIn its statement Saturday, the airport defended its practices, stressing that there are variances in the security system based on various factors and that many layers of protection cannot easily be seen.\n\n\"Proper and effective security requires multiple layers of systems, procedures and policies that are interlaced and constantly monitored,\" the airport said. \"The vast majority of the widespread layers of this security program are behind the scenes and transparent to casual observers.\"\n\nA few days after the pilot posted the videos, he said, the Transportation Security Administration told him he was being suspended from the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. As an officer in that program, the federal agency had deputized him, among others, to carry a handgun in the cockpit.\n\nThe pilot said four air marshals and two local deputies then showed up at his home near Sacramento to personally confiscate his weapon.\n\nThe only answer he could get from the security agency as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation, the pilot said.\n\nThe TSA said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to \"the highest ethical standards,\" and said it took action because the pilot was in the program.\n\n\"(Participants in the flight deck officer program) must be able to maintain sensitive security information,\" said the agency's spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz. \"As the issuing authority of credentials and firearms, TSA reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the pilot said he resigned from the program. He added that he didn't consider that divulging such sensitive information online would stir controversy.\n\n\"I didn't think anything would come of it,\" said the 50-year-old pilot, a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot.\n\n\"This is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security,\" Don Werno, the pilot's attorney, told CNN. \"No state secrets are being shown here. What's being shown here is a lack of security.\"\n\nBut the airport disagrees.\n\n\"San Francisco International Airport is proud to both an innovator and a trendsetter in aviation security,\" it said in its statement. \"SFO meets, and in many cases, exceeds every federal security requirement.\"", "question": "What does the video show?"}

Under state law in such incidents, only a summons is to be issued and the motorist is to be allowed to go.

Some lower courts had ruled that when state arrest law is violated, the Constitution provides a remedy in the suppression of any evidence resulting from the arrest and a related search.\n\nBut the justices agreed with the majority of courts that said constitutional requirements are satisfied when an officer has probable cause to make an arrest, even if some provision of state law was violated in the process.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion suggesting Virginia change its law to make driving on a suspended license an arrestable offense.\n\nDuring arguments, Ginsburg spoke for several colleagues when she pointed out that if a summons had been issued in Moore's case, any incriminating evidence would have been excluded. \"Would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate state law, then the evidence can come in, but when they comply with state law, it can't,\" she asked.\n\nThe ruling means Moore's original jury conviction and 3-½ year prison term will stand.

But when the history of Hollywood's 21st century embrace of 3-D is written, it very well may point to this weekend as the moment when the format definitively established its commercial power at the box office.\n\n\"The Final Destination\" scared up by far the most box office receipts, banking $28.3 million.\n\nDespite a moviegoing weekend dominated with R-rated violent thriller-type films ostensibly shooting for the same audience, \"The Final Destination\" scared up by far the most box office receipts, banking $28.3 million for an easy No. 1 berth, according to early estimates from Hollywood.com Box Office.\n\nThat's almost $10 million better than the opening frame for the last film in the creatively-dispatching-model-perfect-unknown-actors franchise (which, for those keeping track, was \"Final Destination 3\").\n\nThere's really only one reason why: Although just over half its 3,121 theaters were screening the flick in 3-D, fully 70 percent of its box office take was from 3-D theaters, which typically charge an extra few bucks per ticket for the privilege of watching the film with those comfy stereoscopic glasses. Rest assured, despite its title (and its abysmal \"C\" Cinemascore grade), this is by no means the final \"Final Destination\" movie.\n\nThe folks at the The Weinstein Company, meanwhile, continue to enjoy good news for their much scrutinized bottom line: Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" landed at No. 2 with a rather spectacular $20 million, just 47 percent down from its opening weekend for $73.7 million total.\n\nTWC's sister company Dimension Films, meanwhile, saw its \"Halloween II\" debut at third with a nothing-to-sneeze-at $17.4 million. Granted, director Rob Zombie's second re-imagining of the 31-years-old slasher franchise made nothing close to the $30.6 million Labor Day weekend debut of Zombie's first night out with Michael Myers.\n\nBut given the steep competition, and the film's $15 million budget, Dimension must be breathing a sigh of relief that their film will most likely see a decent profit.\n\nThe box office love continued through much of the weekend's top 10: District 9 dropped just 41 percent with $10.7 million, strong enough to hold on at fourth place and, with a $90.8 mil running total, well on its way to joining the $100 million club.\n\nAt number five, \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\" banged out $8 million, a 34 percent drop and $132 million total. And Julie & Julia savored a tiny 16 percent drop for sixth, with $7.4 million in its forth weekend for $70.9 million total.\n\nIn fact, the only true disappointment for the weekend was Focus Features' \"Taking Woodstock.\" Director Ang Lee's trip back to the iconic three-day concert debuted at ninth with just $3.7 million, doubly disappointing since it opened wide in 1,393 theaters (after a Wednesday opening in New York and Los Angeles), with a feeble $2,691 per theater average.\n\nBy contrast, two limited release debuts did rather well: Vogue magazine documentary \"The September Issue\" bowed on six screens with a very fashionable $40,000 per theater average; and the extreme-sports-fandom-gone-wrong dramedy \"Big Fan\" won $13,000 per theater on two screens.\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly", "question": "Which film landed at number two?"}

{"ideal": ["as", "as 80 percent"], "context": "(CNN) -- The federal government has instructed BP to scale back its use of oil dispersants in the Gulf of Mexico, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday.\n\nJackson said she believes BP's total use of dispersants can be reduced by as much as 80 percent. While the dispersants are successfully breaking up much of the oil being spilled into the Gulf, she said, \"we are making environmental tradeoffs\" and are \"deeply concerned\" about potential side effects.\n\nJackson and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the oil spill response effort, told reporters that subsea use of dispersants at the source of the leak will continue. But the federal government strongly prefers to eliminate oil on the surface through a combination of burning and mechanical skimming, they said.\n\nThe \"use of dispersant in the subsea means that you don't need to spray as much (on the surface),\" Jackson later explained. \"The idea from the very beginning was that if you could use it in the subsea ... you wouldn't need to spray as much on top.\"\n\nJackson's announcement came less than a week after EPA ordered BP to find another chemical dispersant to use on the oil spill after concerns arose about the long-term effects of the substance now being used. Federal officials have been seeking an alternative to the hundreds of thousands of gallons of Corexit 9500 that have been sprayed on the oil slick since April. The product has been rated less effective and more toxic than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nCorexit 9500 includes petroleum distillates, propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonic salt, and prolonged contact with it can cause eye or skin irritation, according to the manufacturer's material data safety sheet. The document warns that \"repeated or prolonged exposure may irritate the respiratory tract.\"\n\n\"I wasn't satisfied with the answer that we got\" from BP regarding possible alternatives, Jackson said. While the data compiled so far does \"not show a problem with toxicity\" as a result of the use of Corexit, it \"seems to me that a month into this and with no end in sight ... we need to ask ourselves whether there's a better product out there. And BP seemed to spend a lot of time saying why everything else didn't work.\"\n\nThe EPA is in the process of setting up a series of toxicity tests, Jackson said, \"to look at what's going on out there now and to look at whether there's a better choice.\"\n\nAsked earlier about the company's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an EPA request that it use a less toxic alternative, BP official Tony Hayward said, \"Everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the EPA.\"\n\nOn Monday, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen -- the Obama administration's point man for the spill -- warned reporters at the White House that the \"decision to use dispersants doesn't do away with the problem.\" It simply means \"we are willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land.

And in Mexico that story is the fight for the right to meet U.S. demand for illegal drugs -- a war becoming more violent and ruthless, mostly because of one group.\n\nSuspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April.\n\nIts name is Los Zetas.\n\nImagine a band of U.S. Green Berets going rogue and offering their services and firepower to drug cartels. That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas.\n\nThe U.S. government says Los Zetas is \"the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.\"\n\nLos Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.  Watch scenes of the escalating drug war in Veracruz »\n\nWith their fierce weaponry and military expertise, Los Zetas are considered the most formidable enemy in the drug war.\n\n\"The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides, the narcotic-related homicides, the beheadings, the kidnappings, the extortions that take place in Mexico,\" said Ralph Reyes, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's chief for Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe fight against Los Zetas will take years, Reyes said.\n\n\"They continue to train new recruits through several campaigns. One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas,\" Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas.\n\nWith its mastery of combat, Reyes said, the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja, Iraq, than a street gang.\n\nNewspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels' bloody violence, more often than not linked to Los Zetas. The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations.\n\nAnd now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government. The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas.\n\nAnd, as a DEA agent recently said, the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas. It doesn't matter if violence is perpetrated on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border.\n\nInside the United States, one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta. Given six months of military training in Mexico, he was sent across the border to target rival drug gangs. He was 13 years old when he committed his first killing.\n\n\"I loved doing it,\" Reta says in a police interrogation tape. \"Killing that first person, I loved it.

As a result, older adults might need fewer doses or a lower strength of the vaccine than younger individuals.\"\n\nThe vaccine at this point has been tested only in animals, where it has shown to be effective. Further trials will examine questions such as how the vaccine works in combination with the seasonal flu vaccine and whether including an adjutant, a substance that boosts the immune response to vaccines, can make it work better at lower doses.\n\nOther trial sites along with the University of Maryland Medical Center are Baylor College of Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Emory University, Saint Louis University, Seattle Group Health Cooperative, the University of Iowa, and Vanderbilt University.

She recently spoke with CNN's Sonya Hamasaki about the need to help people improve their lives. Below are excerpts from that interview.\n\nCNN: What inspired you to get involved with Oxfam?\n\nKristin Davis: Oxfam is unique in helping people become independent. That's their goal.\n\nOne of the reasons I got involved was that after the tsunami, I remember all of the fishermen whose entire lives had gotten washed away in Indonesia. I thought, \"How are they ever going to get their livelihoods back?\" Oxfam was committed to staying there until those fishermen got their own livelihoods back together so that they could be self-sufficient..\n\nCNN: You are specifically interested in helping women receive job training and education. Why is that important to you?\n\nDavis: A lot of times, these women have been left alone or their husbands have died of AIDS or different things. I was interested in helping women who may live in a world where they weren't trained to do anything and they weren't afforded an education. Oxfam will go into these communities and try to help out.\n\nIt might be raising chickens, it might be sewing beaded necklaces; they're helping the women empower themselves. And, especially for women, that's a huge, huge life-changing thing to be able to be self-sufficient. The women can then support their children, and usually the women send their children to school and it changes the next generation.\n\nCNN: What is your role as an ambassador?\n\nDavis: The way I perceive my role as an ambassador -- which I think is personal for everyone -- is that I travel to places that I'm interested in, where there's a story or a particular situation with women usually, and I just talk to people and I'm a witness to their story. I come back and try to tell their stories.\n\nJust going is such an inspiration for me that I would do it (if) no one asked me at all.

It also discussed different ways to organize a new entity, either as part of an existing department or as a new agency.\n\nBut there's one thing you won't find in the report -- a recommendation on what to do.\n\n\"We were not asked to make a recommendation, and this assessment does not do so,\" the report says.\n\nInstead, says RAND's Gregory Treverton, the report provides a \"framework\" for policymakers to use when deciding whether and how to reorganize counter-intelligence efforts at home.\n\nRAND is a nonprofit think tank seeking to help improve policy and decision making through objective research and analysis.\n\nCollecting intelligence domestically always has been a sensitive issue, at least partially because of episodic abuses by the government, notably against civil rights leaders, unions, antiwar organizations or even communists and hate groups.\n\nBut the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks renewed calls for increased domestic intelligence to prevent future attacks. Critics said that in the lead-up to the attacks, the FBI devalued counterterrorism agents and failed to heed signs that an attack was imminent.\n\n\"If you didn't carry a gun, you didn't count so much,\" Treverton said.\n\nAfter the attacks, the FBI moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention. It now focuses on terrorism through its National Security Branch and the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThe RAND report focuses on two options to the current system.\n\nIn one, a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence community. A second option is to create an \"agency within an agency\" in the FBI or DHS.\n\nThe first option would result in an organization with a clear, unambiguous mission, and might be able to draw on a more diverse recruitment pool, such as linguists and historians who are not normally attracted to law enforcement. On the flip side, such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance.\n\nThe second option -- an \"agency within an agency\" -- could involve less short-term disruption, but could be hindered by a \"lack of clarity of a single mission,\" the report says.\n\nRAND also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering, such as increasing resources, improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures.\n\nThe report does not assess the FBI's performance since 9/11, Treverton said, but he believes Congress should seek an independent assessment.\n\nA panel of experts that RAND convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one-third since the September 11, 2001. But \"they were not enthusiastic about alternatives\" to current counterterrorism organizations.\n\nIn a cautionary note, the report says that while public acceptance of domestic intelligence activities is imperative, public attitudes about what is considered acceptable \"can both be fragile and shift significantly over time.\"\n\n\"Public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat, and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself,\" the report says.

{"ideal": ["Verizon"], "context": "(WIRED) -- The iPhone 4S is available on three major carriers, leaving potential buyers to wonder whether AT&T, Verizon or Sprint is the better network choice.\n\nPricing plans aside, carrier quality is a significant factor in anyone's purchasing decision, and now consumers have hard data to help them choose: A just-released study reports AT&T is tops for fast data speeds, while Verizon is the most reliable when it comes to making phone calls.\n\nSprint's main draw is that it offers unlimited, albeit slow, data.\n\nThe study was performed by Metrico Wireless, a mobile device performance analytics firm. To test network performance, Metrico made 6,000 voice calls, conducted 8,000 data download/upload tests (both moving and stationary), and downloaded more than 21,000 web pages.\n\nThe tests found that Verizon dropped calls 2.1 percent of the time, while AT&T dropped 2.8 percent of calls and Sprint lost 3.7 percent of calls. The average dropped-call rate for the entire mobile industry is 1.4 percent. Although Sprint dropped the most calls, it had the highest call quality on the uplink (outbound calls), while AT&T had the best downlink call quality (inbound calls).\n\nWith regard to maximum data speeds, AT&T led the pack at 6,047Kbps, with Verizon a distant second at 2,371Kbps, and Sprint crawling in last with only 1,767Kbps. It's unclear, however, exactly where Metrico tested data bandwidth, and as any iPhone-toting San Francisco resident will tell you, data quality can be terrible in areas with high concentrations of tech geeks.\n\nThe original iPhone launched exclusively with AT&T, which was the sole carrier of the iPhone until Apple announced that Verizon would also begin carrying the iPhone 4 in January 2011. Prior to the launch of the iPhone 4S, rumors swirled that the phone would land on Sprint, and ultimately proved true. Of the three carriers, Sprint is the only one that provides a true unlimited data plan.\n\nMetrico's results are consistent with what we found back when Verizon began offering the iPhone 4: AT&T offered better download speeds, while Verizon had better coverage.\n\nAnother important stat Metrico found was that the iPhone 4S performed perfectly across all three networks when it came to data task reliability. In short, 100 percent of the time, the phone was able to complete web-page loads, stationary downloads, and stationary uploads. This contrasts with an earlier Metrico study from March 2011 that found Verizon had a higher download success rate when the phone was stationary, and AT&T had a higher rate while the phone was moving.\n\nSo what's the bottom line? It looks like you're going to get a relatively positive data-downloading experience no matter which carrier you choose, if only because you will be able to download data. But if you value downloading material quickly, you should go with AT&T. If call reliability is paramount, stick with Verizon, and if you want to use a lot of data but don't care about speed, go with Sprint.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

And in Mexico that story is the fight for the right to meet U.S. demand for illegal drugs -- a war becoming more violent and ruthless, mostly because of one group.\n\nSuspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April.\n\nIts name is Los Zetas.\n\nImagine a band of U.S. Green Berets going rogue and offering their services and firepower to drug cartels. That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas.\n\nThe U.S. government says Los Zetas is \"the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.\"\n\nLos Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.  Watch scenes of the escalating drug war in Veracruz »\n\nWith their fierce weaponry and military expertise, Los Zetas are considered the most formidable enemy in the drug war.\n\n\"The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides, the narcotic-related homicides, the beheadings, the kidnappings, the extortions that take place in Mexico,\" said Ralph Reyes, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's chief for Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe fight against Los Zetas will take years, Reyes said.\n\n\"They continue to train new recruits through several campaigns. One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas,\" Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas.\n\nWith its mastery of combat, Reyes said, the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja, Iraq, than a street gang.\n\nNewspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels' bloody violence, more often than not linked to Los Zetas. The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations.\n\nAnd now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government. The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas.\n\nAnd, as a DEA agent recently said, the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas. It doesn't matter if violence is perpetrated on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border.\n\nInside the United States, one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta. Given six months of military training in Mexico, he was sent across the border to target rival drug gangs. He was 13 years old when he committed his first killing.\n\n\"I loved doing it,\" Reta says in a police interrogation tape. \"Killing that first person, I loved it. I thought I was Superman.\"\n\nU.S. officials have said there are many more like him.", "question": "What country does Los Zetas come from"}
{"ideal": ["17"], "context": "(CNN)  -- Chelsea King, 17, was a straight-A student, a high school track star and she loved to volunteer. Now, she's been killed, the latest victim of what you could call \"junk justice.\"\n\nWhen Chelsea went running in a San Diego, California, park, it's doubtful she had any idea that another young female runner had been attacked in that very same park just a couple of months before.\n\nThat first victim said she feared her attacker was going to rape her. She managed to get away by elbowing the large man in the nose.\n\nIf there were falling rocks in that park, a warning sign would be up. If a hungry coyote had been spotted scrounging for food, a warning sign would tell you.  But there was no warning at all that a human predator, on the hunt for young women, might be in the park. If there had been a sketch of this suspect, or a warning posted, Chelsea might not have gone running alone there.\n\nPolice said DNA on Chelsea's underwear led them to 30-year-old John Gardner III. They showed his picture to the first runner and she said, \"He's the same guy.\" Now he's been charged with Chelsea's rape and murder.\n\nThe suspect was a registered sex offender. In 2000, he lured a 13-year-old girl into his home on the pretext of watching the movie \"Patch Adams.\" Once he got her inside, he molested her and beat her to a pulp before she escaped.\n\nBefore Gardner was sentenced, a psychiatrist warned that he showed no remorse and would likely attack a young girl again. He recommended \"the maximum sentence allowed by law.\"\n\nThe courts sentenced Gardner to six years; he got out after five. Five years for pummeling a 13-year-old girl in the face and fondling her. That is \"junk justice.\"\n\nIf Gardner had been prosecuted to the full extent of the law then, he would have been behind bars when Chelsea went for a run on February 25. Her grieving mom spoke directly to this point to Larry King Thursday night...\"I mean how many times do our daughters need to be raped before we put these monsters behind bars forever? I just don't -- I don't get it. Change has to be made. And I know that there are people out there that are -- that are trying to, you know, get this change in place. And Brent and I are committed for the rest of our lives to be a part of that.\"\n\nWe need to switch our focus from punishment to prevention. Our system only kicks into high gear after the fact. In this case, a warning sign, something that simple, would have cost a fraction of the millions it might take to prosecute and house the killer. A warning sign that a woman had been attacked in the park could have possibly saved Chelsea's life.\n\nIn California, for every one parole officer there are 70 criminals.  Companies like Google, FedEx, and eBay use high-tech systems to track packages and information. We already have the technology in the form of ankle bracelets to track the sex predators so why not use it?\n\nThink about this. We can carefully track the delivery of a package across the country but don't keep track of a sex offender who weighs more than 200 pounds. It's time that we demand the most basic freedom of all, and that is freedom from fear.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.", "question": "Chelsea King, straight-A student was how old?"}

A good bet is the Toei and Tokyo Metro One-Day Economy Pass, which costs ¥1,000 and gives you a day of unlimited travel on all subway lines. During rush-hour the subway becomes an unbearable crush. All social niceties go out the window in a free for all that's best avoided completely.\n\nTaxis During the day traffic can be gridlocked, but in the evening, when traffic is lighter, taxis are reasonably alternative to the subway. Enter and exit taxis by the back left-hand door. Don't make the novice's error of trying to open or close the door -- your white-gloved driver will do that from the front seat. Ideally, have a map of your destination, or at least an address written in Japanese.

That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas.\n\nThe U.S. government says Los Zetas is \"the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.\"\n\nLos Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.

One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas,\" Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas.\n\nWith its mastery of combat, Reyes said, the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja, Iraq, than a street gang.\n\nNewspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels' bloody violence, more often than not linked to Los Zetas. The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations.\n\nAnd now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government.

It allows each religion to decide whether to acknowledge same-sex marriage but extends the option of civil marriage to any two individuals, said state Senate spokeswoman Anne Saunders.\n\nThe House, which passed the earlier version last month by a margin of seven votes, 186-179, must approve the changed version before it can be sent to Gov.

Wednesday's crash is the first on record for Caspian Airlines, which was founded in 1993, he added.\n\nThe plane crashed 16 minutes after takeoff, said the newspaper Hamshari, quoting a spokesman from Iran's civil aviation organization.\n\nThat would have put the flight in one of the safest stages of travel, according to International Air Transport Association data. Only about 5 percent of accidents take place during the phase called en-route climb, 16 to 20 minutes into a flight, when a plane climbs to cruising altitude of 35,000 feet.\n\nAbout half of accidents take place during landing.", "question": "What team went to Iran to help study the crash of Russian-made plane?"}

While he was a controversial figure, he clearly attracts the attention of the global media,\" he continued.\n\nThe Facebook page has become an online memorial to Jackson, with thousands of comments from around the world; dozens appear every minute.\n\nFree virtual versions of Jackson's famous glove are the most popular gift on the site, with more than 800,000 sent to members.\n\nThe huge following leaves the singer's heirs (and his record label) with a massive network to communicate with fans and continue the massive resurgence of interest in Jackson's music, O'Neill said.\n\n\"While Sony has not heavily engaged the fan base on Michael Jackson's page, they at least have a presence. If your fans are there, you should be there.\n\n\"This also provided an ongoing promotional channel for any future products that are released.

A story like this makes sponsors very nervous because they don't know if there's more to come,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"Most companies will have a morality clause as part of the contract with a big name like Woods. This is usually enforced because of drugs [or criminal issues], but in a situation like this which is ongoing, there's a good chance these companies will exercise their rights and jump ship.\"\n\nHowever, while Woods --, the first sportsman to earn $1 billion -- might possibly lose some sponsors, other revenue streams could be exploited, according to Currie. Will Tiger Woods return to golf the same?\n\n\"This chink in his armor won't impact his earning capacity, but companies and brands will think differently in the future. It will open up new offers and close a few doors too,\" he said.\n\nWhile golf is traditionally a very conservative sport which attracts like minded backers, it is still possible to bring in sponsors even in cases as extreme as John Daly -- whose drinking, smoking and eating problems put his career at risk.\n\nDaly's less than wholesome image paid dividends in 2005 when the American teamed up with restaurant chain Hooters, known for its scantily-clad waitresses, in what seemed a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nHooters vice-president Mike McNeil said in a statement on Daly's Web site: \"John is unique, successful and a man of the people who doesn't really worry too much about what the establishment thinks. In fact he's a lot like Hooters.\"\n\nBut the appeal of Daly's carefree attitude also proved to be his downfall when, in November 2008, the golfer was found drunk and face down in a flower bed outside a Hooters restaurant. Earlier this year, Hooters quietly relinquished their contract with the colorful, larger-than-life character.\n\nAnother player who has successfully surfed the wave of marketing and endorsement despite a checkered personal life is European golfing legend Nick Faldo.\n\nDespite two divorces and a number of well-documented affairs -- including a three-year liaison with 20-year-old Brenna Cepelak which ended famously with the American student battering Faldo's Porsche with a golf club -- sponsorship has never eluded the golfer.\n\nFaldo also went on to cement his position among the game's elite when he captained the European Ryder Cup team in 2008.\n\nTime will tell if Tiger Woods' self-confessed \"personal failings\" will impact on his career, but his world-beating marketability may have to undergo some change.", "question": "what golfers have bounced back from pr nightmares?"}

As part of that plea agreement, she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, federal prosecutors have said.\n\nBarzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home.\n\nThe month after Smart was kidnapped, prosecutors alleged, Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin, but were unsuccessful. The girl was 15 years old at the time, according to CNN affiliate KSL. She is not named in court documents.\n\n\"Mr. Mitchell's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened, which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee,\" the court documents said.\n\nFollowing her arrest in 2003, Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home in order to abduct the girl, and planned to hold her, along with Smart, in the couple's camp in the mountains, according to court documents.\n\nSentencing is set for May 21 on the state charge, Volmer said.

Federal sentencing was set for May 19, but a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors has said a sentence would not be imposed until Barzee's cooperation against Mitchell is complete.\n\nAt the hearing in federal court, Barzee apologized to Smart, according to a transcript.\n\n\"I'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it,\" she said. \"I'm so sorry, Elizabeth, for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged continued support for national reconciliation efforts in Somalia, which has been without an effective central government since 1991.\n\n\"It is important that these efforts should have a tangible effect in improving the security environment for the Somali people and humanitarian actors,\" Ban said in a statement released by his office. \"The United Nations will provide strong logistical support to the African Union's AMISOM force and help develop Somali security forces.\"\n\nHe also encouraged AU leaders to consider a plan that will incorporate AMISOM into a larger U.N. peacekeeping force in the months ahead.\n\nAMISOM was set up to take over from Ethiopian forces, which were supposed to be withdrawn soon after the December 2006 invasion that deposed the Islamic Courts Union, which Ahmed once led. But the Ethiopians and the country's U.N.-backed transitional government were soon battling Islamist guerrillas, including the militia al-Shabaab -- which the United States has designated as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda.\n\nThe transitional government eventually signed a peace agreement with a new movement led by Ahmed, the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. But al-Shabaab has rejected the deal and continued fighting.\n\nThe militia overran the town of Baidoa, the seat of the transitional government, within hours of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops last week. Ahmed was elected president Saturday by lawmakers in Djibouti, and many Somalis view him as a final hope to challenge the militia and its extremist ideology.\n\nCNN's Amir Ahmed and Ahmednor Mohamed Farah for CNN contributed to this report.", "question": "what strikes African Union peacekeepers"}

Critics said that in the lead-up to the attacks, the FBI devalued counterterrorism agents and failed to heed signs that an attack was imminent.\n\n\"If you didn't carry a gun, you didn't count so much,\" Treverton said.\n\nAfter the attacks, the FBI moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention. It now focuses on terrorism through its National Security Branch and the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThe RAND report focuses on two options to the current system.\n\nIn one, a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence community. A second option is to create an \"agency within an agency\" in the FBI or DHS.\n\nThe first option would result in an organization with a clear, unambiguous mission, and might be able to draw on a more diverse recruitment pool, such as linguists and historians who are not normally attracted to law enforcement. On the flip side, such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance.\n\nThe second option -- an \"agency within an agency\" -- could involve less short-term disruption, but could be hindered by a \"lack of clarity of a single mission,\" the report says.\n\nRAND also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering, such as increasing resources, improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures.\n\nThe report does not assess the FBI's performance since 9/11, Treverton said, but he believes Congress should seek an independent assessment.\n\nA panel of experts that RAND convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one-third since the September 11, 2001. But \"they were not enthusiastic about alternatives\" to current counterterrorism organizations.\n\nIn a cautionary note, the report says that while public acceptance of domestic intelligence activities is imperative, public attitudes about what is considered acceptable \"can both be fragile and shift significantly over time.\"\n\n\"Public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat, and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself,\" the report says.

Sip cocktails at Victors -- if the weather's good, grab your drinks and head to the outdoor terrace. An equally popular hangout is nearby Moosehead, which has a more casual-woodsy vibe. Be sure to order the moose meat burger.\n\nA vibrant club scene exists in Malmo, which is home to Slagthuset (Jorgen Kocksgatan 7A) -- the largest nightclub in Scandinavia. Young dancers spread out over three dance floors at the club located behind Central Station. As its name suggests, Club Prive (Malmborgsgatan 7) draws an exclusive crowd.\n\nTo chill in style, head to Torso Twisted (Vastra Varvsgatan 44) in the hip Western Harbor district. The restaurant serves gastronomic delights, and at night the lounge is decidedly cool. Indulge in one of the lavish cocktails or sample from the impressive wine list.\n\nYou can also find the trendy set partying the evening away at Hipp (Kalendegatan 12). You can hang out in the restaurant or two bars or head straight to the pulsating nightclub.\n\nSatisfy your thirst for beer at Tva Krogare (Storgatan 35). The pub dishes up traditional Swedish fare and you'll likely find locals playing a game of darts. For a taste of British in Malmo, try The Bishop's Arms (Norra Vallgatan 62). Located inside the Hotel Savoy, it serves staples like fish and chips and has a wide assortment of beers available.\n\nIf parties begin in Lilla Torg, they tend to end in Mollevangen. The bohemian neighborhood is dotted with bars that stay open well into the night. Prices in this area aren't as cheap as they once were but are still lower than compared to what you'll find in the city center.\n\nLocal musicians hang out at hip Tempo Bar and Kok (Sodra Skolgatan 30). For something a little different, try Chokladfabriken (Bergsgatan 33), a club housed in an old chocolate factory that plays mostly hip hop, funk and soul.\n\nMalmo's passion for music makes it a great place to take in live performances. Kulturbolaget (Bergsgatan 18), one of the best venues for live acts, is a veritable Swedish institution. The club puts on about 220 rock concerts annually. Inkonst (Bergsgatan 29), a so-called culture house, puts on shows and club evenings. Jazz enthusiasts get into their groove at Jeriko (Spangatan 38), named such because it's housed in a former church.\n\n....................

The researchers examined the meters used in San Francisco, California, but the same and similar electronic meters are being installed in cities around the world.\n\n\"It wasn't technically complicated and the fact that I can do it in three days means that other people are probably already doing it and probably taking advantage of it,\" said Joe Grand, a designer and hardware hacker and one of the hosts of the Discovery Channel's \"Prototype This\" show. \"It seems like the system wasn't analyzed at all.\"\n\nGrand and fellow researcher Jake Appelbaum presented their findings Thursday afternoon at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. The researchers did not contact the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or the meter maker prior to their talk, and asked reporters not to contact those organizations ahead of their presentation, for fear of being gagged by a court order.\n\nAt last year's DefCon hacker conference, MIT students were barred from talking about similar vulnerabilities in smartcards used by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority after the MBTA obtained a restraining order. They spoke with Threat Level about their findings prior to the presentation.\n\n\"We're not picking on San Francisco,\" Grand said. \"We're not even claiming to get free parking. We're trying to educate people about ... how they can take our research and apply it to their own cities if they are trying to deploy their own systems or make them more secure.... Cities all over the nation and all over the world are deploying these smartcard meters [and] there's a number of previously known problems with various parking meters in other cities.\"\n\nSan Francisco launched a $35-million pilot project in 2003 to deploy smart meters around the city in an effort to thwart thieves, including parking control officers who were skimming money from the meters.\n\nThe city estimated it was losing more than $3 million annually to theft. In response, it installed 23,000 meters made by a Canadian firm named J.J. MacKay, which also has meters in Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Canada, Hong Kong and other locales.\n\nThe machines are hybrids that allow drivers to insert either coins, or a pre-paid GemPlus smart card, which can be purchased in values of $20 or $50. The machines also have an audit log to help catch insiders who might skim proceeds.\n\nTo record the communication between the card and the meter, Grand purchased a smartcard shim -- an electrical connector that duplicates a smartcard's contact points -- and used an oscilloscope to record the electrical signals as the card and meter communicated.\n\nHe discovered the cards aren't digitally signed, and the only authentication between the meter and card is a password sent from the former to the latter. The card doesn't have to know the password, however, it just has to respond that the password is correct.\n\nThe cards sold in San Francisco are designed to be thrown out when the customer has exhausted them. But the researchers found that the meters perform no upper-bounds check, so hackers could easily boost the transaction limit on a card beyond what could legitimately purchased. They could also program a card to simply never deduct from the transaction count.\n\n\"We're residents of San Francisco and our taxes are going towards a broken system that they could potentially be losing money on and we pay the consequences of that,\" Grand said.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

Yes, reading the details of the treatment of the dogs, including the killing of some of them, could make anyone sick. Yet what's the point of sentencing someone to jail, then having them serve their time and be released if we still want to imprison them for the rest of their lives?\n\nFrankly, I'm sick of Americans who talk all day about \"do the crime, then do the time,\" then still want to treat a man like a criminal when he gets out of prison.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to Michael Vick. Look at all the individuals who are sent to prison, get out and then can't find a job. Why? Because they have the Scarlet Letter on their record, which is a big fat \"F\" for felon. Don't think I'm looking for any sympathy for someone who goes to jail. I firmly believe that you deserve all that you get for breaking the law. But listening to some of these zealots go on and on and on about Vick needing to continue to be punished is ridiculous!\n\nThe judge in Vick's case has imposed a number of restrictions. One of them is that he can't ever own a dog again. OK, gotcha. But to say the man shouldn't be allowed to play in the NFL is D-U-M-B. The crimes of which he was convicted had nothing to do with playing sports.\n\nRemember Wall Street star Michael Milken? When he was sent to jail for securities fraud, he was banned from working on Wall Street again. I get that. He was an insider and allowing him back into the financial game would have been atrocious.\n\nI get it when someone is convicted of molesting children that they can't live within a certain distance of a school or be left alone around children when released. But there is nothing related to Vick's crime that says he should not be allowed to play professional football.\n\nWhat is particularly galling is that, right now, you have any number of football players who have beaten people -- including their wives and girlfriends -- served time for drunk driving or committed other crimes, yet they have resumed their careers. The same goes for teachers, radio and television broadcasters, politicians and others.\n\nSo is this any different because it involved dogs? Are we to say that the horrible treatment of dogs is vastly different than mistreatment of human beings? The critics will likely say, \"These men are role models. Kids look up to them. They should have no business on the field.\" Yet some of these same kids are living with fathers and mothers who are felons. So are we supposed to remove them from the home as well?\n\nEnough with the public bullying. Vick was sentenced and served his time. And now he's gotten out. If you want to be angry with him, fine.

The idea we use the sun's energy to grow plants and then make fuels from those plants is essentially a good one,\" Dr. Long said.\n\n\"It's been tainted by the fact that the easy way to do it is to just use food crops, but society needs to realize there are big opportunities beyond food crops and beyond the use of crop land.\"\n\nMiscanthus, for instance, is able to grow on land too marginal for crop production, so it doesn't have to compete with land for food crops. It also doesn't require major input or fertilization after planting and once established will yield for around 15 years.\n\nYet even with the success of these trials in the U.S. and the earlier European ones, it could be years before the full potential of Miscanthus is realized.\n\nThis is due in part to the fact that it's much more complex to make cellulosic ethanol -- ethanol made from non-food plants -- than it is to turn simple food starches found in corn or wheat into ethanol.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Miscanthus is recognized by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as an energy crop and it's currently being used to co-fire the Drax power station in England's Yorkshire.\n\nEven still, Dr. Geraint Evans from the UK's National Non-Food Crops Centre said rather than plants like Miscanthus, wheat grain will be used to meet the UK target of replacing five percent of fuel with renewable sources by 2010.\n\n\"Miscanthus has the potential to be more efficient, producing between 4,000 and 7,000 liters of fuel per hectare, whereas ethanol made from wheat grain makes about 1900 liters per hectare.\"\n\n\"Wheat grain-derived ethanol is what we can do today with the technology we have available today. The technology to use Miscanthus is not yet commercially available,\" Dr. Evans told CNN.\n\nIn addition to the technical hitch, Dr. Evans said a further downside is that even though Miscanthus is a low maintenance crop, it can be costly to plant compared to wheat or rapeseed canola and the first yield wouldn't occur for at least three years.\n\nIn an effort to overcome some of the challenges, Dr. Long now intends to turn his attention to experimenting with the wild Miscanthus used in the U.S. trial.\n\nAnd if the sort of improvements made to corn in the last 50 years are any indication, Miscanthus could be well be used to fuel the future in a matter of years.

However, launches often are delayed because of inclement weather or technical concerns.\n\nDiscovery will carry a crew of seven astronauts as it ferries equipment to the space station. One of the astronauts, Nicole Stott, will remain on the space station as a flight engineer, replacing astronaut Timothy Kopra, who will return home aboard Discovery as a mission specialist, according to the NASA Web page for the mission.\n\nDiscovery will also be carrying the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT) to the space station. The treadmill is named for fake newsman Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report.\"\n\nEarlier this year, NASA conducted an online poll to name the space station's newest compartment, asking voters to choose one of four given options or offer their own suggestion. Colbert urged his viewers to suggest \"Colbert,\" which won.\n\nBut Colbert and the space agency compromised to give the moniker to the treadmill instead. The new module was given the name Tranquility.\n\n\"I'm so proud my treadmill will be going into space to help trim down those famously fat astronauts. Lay off the Tang, Chubby!\" Colbert said in a statement.\n\nThe mission will be Discovery's 37th to space, and the 30th shuttle mission dedicated to assembly and maintenance of the space station, NASA says.", "question": "What is slated to lift off Tuesday?"}

Don't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed.

Thirty-thousand people were pulled off roofs right after the storm moved through. It's a pretty quick response. Could things have been done better? Absolutely. Absolutely. But when I hear people say, the federal response was slow, then what are they going to say to those chopper drivers, or the 30,000 that got pulled off the roofs?\"\n\nIt is impossible to challenge what so many of us witnessed firsthand -- what the entire country witnessed through television day and night: New Orleans was a city for a time abandoned by the government; where people old and young were left at the New Orleans convention center for days with no water or food.\n\nPeople will disagree over aspects of the Bush legacy, but on the government's handling of Katrina?\n\nWe were there.

Gelbart also was involved in the short-lived sequel, \"After MASH.\"\n\nFor Gelbart, \"M*A*S*H\" mixed a bit of comedy with drama, allowing viewers to connect more with the story.\n\n\"I said once that the only way before 'M*A*S*H' you would get any feeling out of your television set is if you touched it while you were wet,\" Gelbart said.\n\nHe added: \"We gave the audience permission to feel bad. Because America was feeling pretty rotten then, we were at war in Vietnam. And once the war stopped we didn't start feeling really terrific right away, if we ever will again about that situation.\"\n\nGelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film \"Tootsie,\" \"Oh, God!\" in 1977 and the 2003 film \"And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself,\" which starred Antonio Banderas. \"Tootsie\" earned Gelbart an Oscar nomination for best writing.", "question": "when gelbart died?"}

Rather, the letter that Cambodia's permanent mission in New York submitted to the chairmen of the Security Council and the General Assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day Sunday.\n\nThe two countries agreed to meet Monday to defuse tensions -- even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple.\n\nBoth Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.\n\nThe International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated.\n\nThailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country's territory.\n\nEarlier this month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value.\n\nThe decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple.\n\nOpposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.\n\nA Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama.

Increasingly, they're messaging on their phones through texts, e-mail, Facebook or Twitter -- streams of incoming information that are now accessible to us anytime and anywhere we have a signal.\n\nAccording to a trade industry report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the United States has 327 million cell phone subscribers, more than its 315 million people.\n\nShlain believes her film presents technology as a next step in shaping society.\n\n\"These phones extend our desire for emotional connection. So these are all expanding human capacity because it's us evolving. We continue to want to have more ways to exchange ideas and connect,\" she said.\n\nBut Shlain also thinks there is a darker side to our always-on, always-connected society.\n\n\"People have gotten incredibly rude. When you are with a good friend you should not have your cell phone right here like a ticking bomb. I think there should be no texting in funerals. When you walk in to greet your husband or partner, you should not be talking on a cell phone.\"\n\nIn the film, Shlain ponders what the lasting impact of this information explosion will be.\n\n\"I wonder if people are going to look back on this period and say, 'I cannot believe people used their cell phones so much in every situation and there were no boundaries,\" she said.\n\nIn her own life, Shlain has taken action to limit her digital diet. One day a week, she and her family have a technology shutdown.\n\n\"All of the screens go off for 24 hours and it's the most delicious, long, wonderful day. I read, I write in my journal, I hang out with my kids and my husband and the day feels like four days in one. Then we all can't wait to go back online.

Only trace amounts of water were found in rocks and soil brought back to Earth, and that water may have resulted from contamination during the retrieval process, scientists said.  Watch report on discovery of more sources of moon water »\n\nMustard was on a team led by Carle Pieters, science manager of the NASA-supported Keck Reflectance Experiment Laboratory at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nPieters also is principal investigator for NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), which the space agency contributed to India's first mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-1, in October 2008. The mapper was a \"state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer\" that provided the first map of the entire lunar surface at high resolution, revealing the minerals of which it is made.\n\nExamining data from Chandrayaan-1, Pieters' team found signs of water at the moon's frigid poles. The researchers believe it might have migrated from elsewhere on the moon's surface, attracted by the cold, they said.\n\nTheir overall findings also were confirmed by data from a high-tech spectrometer on the Cassini spacecraft -- which also found evidence of water at lower latitudes away from the poles -- and from infrared mapping done by the Deep Impact spacecrafts -- which found trace amounts over much of the moon's surface.\n\nReports on those findings came from teams led by Roger Clark of the U.S. Geological Survey and Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland.\n\nThis most recent information is far more precise than any previous data, Mustard said. Previous measurements were \"the size of Texas, say, and now are the size of Providence.\"\n\n\"We find it (water) distributed more broadly,\" he added.\n\nIn the late 1990s, scientists found pockets of hydrogen on the moon, and inferred that its molecules could bond with oxygen to make water, the professor said. He called the older information much coarser.\n\nThis time, researchers are reassured that the components are on the moon to make water because of the presence of hydroxyl -- produced when hydrogen and oxygen also bond with a mineral structure.\n\nThe researchers said the results also suggest that the molecules are continually being created on the lunar surface, perhaps as a result of the solar wind -- the stream of ionized particles ejected by the sun.\n\nThe research reports were being posted Thursday by the journal Science, at the Science Express Web site, www.sciencexpress.org, and will be in the magazine that comes out Friday.\n\nA news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Washington.", "question": "What is in the lunar soil?"}

But groups on both sides of the issue asked the high court for broader guidance on settling state-federal conflicts involving institutional reform mandates, especially those involving disadvantaged groups.\n\nSuch political turf battles often end up in the courts, and can lead to decades of federal oversight, such as the fight over school desegregation beginning in the 1950s.

In Los Angeles County, where Brentwood is, the Superior Court has set the cost at about $93 for the first ticket and $201 for the next one, meaning Shriver would owe at least $300 in fines and court fees had she been caught by police, CNN affiliate KTLA-TV reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, Schwarzenegger sent a Twitter message to TMZ editor Harvey Levin: \"Thanks for bringing her violations to my attention. There's going to be swift action.\" What that action might entail was not specified.\n\nShriver on Wednesday issued an apology:\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said in a statement. \"I will be donating my favorite old cell phone to my Women's Conference partner Verizon through their HopeLine program that helps domestic violence shelters. I invite anyone else who wants to recycle their old phone to join me. That's my version of swift action with a higher purpose.\"\n\nThe traffic office referred questions about Shriver to the governor's office, which declined to comment.\n\n\"We don't really think that hand-held bans have a whole lot of impact,\" said Jonathan Adkins, spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington. The association urges drivers not to use phones, including hands-free devices, while driving, but does not support laws banning them, he said.\n\nThe attention to Shriver \"alludes to a bigger problem, and that's the fact that everybody does it,\" Adkins said. \"Not only are public officials doing it, but we have to educate the highway safety community. ... Cops frequently are on their cell phones when they drive.\n\n\"The Shriver case really underscores the scope of the problem. We have a lot of educating to do.\"\n\nShriver's most recent alleged violations come on the heels of AAA Northern California's \"Heads Up Driving Week,\" during which the auto club urged motorists to get in the habit of driving without distractions such as cell phones, fast food and tuning the stereo.\n\n\"We hope that by driving distraction-free for a week, people can pick up the habit for life,\" AAA spokesman Matt Skryja said in a news release.\n\nSeven states and the District of Columbia ban all handheld cell phone use by drivers. Several other states allow localities to set their own limits on cell phone use.", "question": "How many tickets did California Highway Patrol issue in first year?"}

Christie's traces it thus: King Philip IV of Spain (1605-1665) selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter, the Infanta Margarita Teresa (1651-1673). She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria (1640-1705), who later became Holy Roman Emperor.

He rushed him to the animal hospital.\n\n\"They arrived at 6:59 p.m., right as we were about to lock up,\" hospital staffer Michelle Duncum told CNN. \"Mr. Wagers walked into the hospital and asked if we could please help him.\"\n\nStaffers were shocked when they saw Smokey, she said. \"We had never dealt with anything like this before.\"\n\nVeterinarian Keaton Smith knew Smokey's treatment might be expensive and spoke with Wagers about options, Smith wrote.\n\nKeaton Smith offered to treat Smokey at the hospital's expense if Wagers allowed the hospital to call media outlets about the Chihuahua's story. However, staffers wanted to make sure Smokey would live through the night first before calling anyone, Su Smith said.\n\nIt only took the veterinarian about 30 seconds to remove the fork from Smokey's head, Duncum said. And when the veterinarian arrived at the hospital the next morning, July 8, he found Smokey \"recovering much better than expected,\" Su Smith wrote.\n\nSmokey has been advised to take it easy for a few weeks, but is expected to fully recover, Duncum said.\n\nThe Chihuahua's owner did not immediately return a call seeking comment from CNN.\n\n\"Dr. Smith asks everyone who believes this is a cruelty case to 'please back off' and stop jumping to unfounded conclusions,\" Su Smith wrote. \"If you have never had an accident of any kind, you may cast the first stone, but there will be no criminal charges filed in this case.\"", "question": "What us the outlook for the dog?"}

His death is only the next stage of the loss. Michael Jackson left the music world to mourn -- but many of us, especially black Americans, felt like we lost a family member on Thursday. He pained and puzzled us, but we still loved him.\n\nUntil Thursday, some of us had forgotten how much.\n\nMichael was not always easy to love. He tested us, sometimes asking us to ignore what we could see with our own eyes. We may never know fully what Michael did or didn't do, but he was like the lost relative we wished we could bring back to shore.\n\nWhen Jason asked questions about Michael's changing face in the videos, I showed him the beautiful brown-skinned, bright-eyed little boy who grew up in my family's living room.\n\nThere is supreme irony in the death of Michael Jackson the same year as the inauguration of the first black president. Michael, who would ascend higher than any black artist in music history, learned a bitter lesson: Even at the top of the mountain, there is only the man in the mirror.\n\nJason isn't old enough to fully understand black and white, why his grandmother was sent to jail for ordering a hamburger at a Woolworth lunch counter in 1960, or how an ill-used child's soul might never find its way back home.\n\nSo I told Jason about the time Mommy, Grandma, Grandpa, Aunt Lydia and Aunt Johnita [now an assistant general counsel at CNN] drove from Miami to Jacksonville to see the Jacksons' Victory Tour in 1984, when Michael Jackson ruled the world. How his aunties and I dressed up for the concert in our own gloves.\n\nAfter the concert, still floating from the surreal experience, we approached a stretch limousine on the highway.

When the rear door opened, a white blond-haired decoy stepped out -- wearing a silver Michael Jackson glove.\n\nIf only we'd never seen past the tinted window.\n\nIf only we had a perfect memory of Michael waving goodbye.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tananarive Due.", "question": "The mourning began long ago with what?"}
