Block, who cites unnamed sources, says Amazon used the design for the unpopular BlackBerry tablet as a starting point.\n\nEven though details about the device haven't been confirmed, Block and other bloggers are already throwing water on the Kindle Fire.\n\n\"Although Amazon did refresh the ID of their PlayBook derivative, I'm told that this first tablet of theirs is 'supposed to be pretty poor' and is a 'stopgap' in order to get a tablet out the door for the 2011 holiday season -- which doesn't exactly leave the best taste in my mouth,\" he writes. \"But it's also not the most uncommon story, either: when you're breaking into a new market, sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to get in the game. You may remember how crappy the original Kindle was compared to later models!\"\n\nThree major magazine companies have signed on to provide content for the new Kindle tablet, according to Peter Kafka at the blog network AllThingsD, which is owned by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHearst, Conde Nast and Meredith will sell digital versions of their magazines on the upcoming Kindle tablet; but Time Inc., which shares a parent company with CNN, will not settle on a deal this week, Kafka says.\n\nAll of this is just conjecture for now, of course.\n\nAmazon's press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday in New York. Many details should become clearer then.\n\nBarnes & Noble, one of Amazon's competitors in e-books, is expected to announce a new version of its Nook color e-reader later this year.", "question": "as the Amazon tablet will be called?"}

He was convicted of lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor, attempted sexual assault with a minor and other related charges.\n\nHe showed no reaction as the verdict was read after more than four hours of jury deliberations, according to KLAS. Sentencing was set for May 8.\n\nThe crime triggered a national manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\nJurors in Stiles' trial viewed the videotape, but the judge would not allow members sitting in the gallery to view it, and a screen was put up to block the jury box, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some members of the media were allowed to view the tape as well, but the judge did not want the reactions of reporters or the public to influence jurors, he said.\n\nThe charges also related to another girl who Stiles was accused of sexually assaulting on videotape.\n\nThe tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.\n\nAfter attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for her mother said she was 7 years old and safe and healthy.\n\nThe rape occurred before the girl's third birthday, while she was in the care of a baby-sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture.\n\nIn an appearance on \"The Dr. Phil Show,\" the girl's mother said the girl has no recollection of the assault.\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate, and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance.\n\nStiles eventually admitted who he was and that he was being sought, authorities said.\n\nThe man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others.\n\nA judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years of probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.\n\nBrooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 2008, the world cast its eyes on Beijing, the sprawling Chinese metropolis that was set to play host to the Summer Olympics.\n\nAt VBS.TV, we caught wind of another story that soon had our full attention. As Chinese officials were taking unprecedented and often controversial measures to sanitize the notoriously foul Beijing air, much of the rest of the country was still covered in a thick blanket of noxious smog.\n\nAccording to a World Bank survey at the time, 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities were in China.\n\nAt the top of that list is the city of Linfen, a coal-mining and manufacturing hub in the heart of Shanxi Province. Within weeks, we assembled a film crew and went off to the landlocked province in northern China to find out more.\n\nAfter touching down in Beijing and making a quick visit to the Olympic countdown clock, we set out to visit the single most polluted place on Earth, hoping to place the dubious ranking into a human context.\n\nDespite the Chinese government's promise of a marathon-friendly city, the Beijing air at the time was still plenty oppressive. But nothing could have prepared us for the dystopian scenario we encountered during our week in Linfen and the surrounding area.\n\nSee the rest of Toxic Linfen at VBS.TV\n\nBefore the trip, I had researched thousands of images of the pollution that plagues Linfen and Shanxi province, but to see it in person is, quite simply, devastating.\n\nThe sun sets before it is supposed to, disappearing into a curtain of smog above the true horizon. Residents scavenge the roadside for coal that falls from the seemingly endless cavalcade of coal trucks, gathering it with bare hands. Schoolchildren play against the nonstop backdrop of billowing exhaust. Many of the elderly have trouble speaking between gasps of widespread emphysema.\n\nResidents of Linfen are aware of the growing threat the polluted air and water pose, and some of them have left the city. Most, however, have no choice but to stay.\n\nThe infamy of a No. 1 ranking in the news media eventually motivated China to focus more attention on cleaning up Linfen, but unfortunately, the scene of overwhelming pollution is still rampant in many parts of the country.\n\nAs easy as it is to criticize China's bold industrial development, our visit was also a clear reminder of the same pattern of manufacturing and consumption that has occurred elsewhere since the dawn of the Industrial Age.\n\nIn China, it just happens to be on a much grander scale and on the back of a globalized economy that has rendered China into an assembly line for the world. The most compelling research I came across to this end are recently published studies showing particulate matter from China's factories and mines reaching across the Pacific Ocean to North America's West Coast.\n\nChina obviously has some cleaning up to do, and more importantly, some major strategizing to achieve a sustainable economy.\n\nOur futures are inextricably linked. Back in New York City, the coal mines of Shanxi Province feel worlds away, but as oil now gushes ceaselessly into our own backyard, we should pay even more attention to Linfen if we don't want it to be a glimpse into our own future.", "question": "What does the city of Linfen have?"}

The women who got the supplements, compared with those taking a placebo, had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of AMD, and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of AMD.\n\nEpidemiologist and study author William G. Christen, Sc.D., of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies, \"the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age-related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking.\"\n\nChristen also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older, there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men.\n\nChristen and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid in AMD partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine, an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of AMD.\n\nThe 5,442 women who participated in the randomized, double-blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The majority of them did not have AMD at the start of the study, which lasted more than 7 years. Christen explains that the underlying mechanism of AMD likely involves the vascular system, and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and AMD share common risk factors.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60, involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula, the central part of the retina. The condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly, as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision.\n\n\"If you affect that central part of your vision, no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life,\" explains Dr. Roy Rubinfeld, ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nThere are two types of macular degeneration: wet and dry. Wet forms of AMD are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula, which can rupture and bleed. The dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function.\n\nWhile some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease (including laser surgery, photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye), there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form.\n\nWhen asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for AMD should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid, retina specialist Dr. Robert Frank of the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests probably not yet.\n\n\"If you do anything, I would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins A, E, C and zinc,\" suggests Frank, who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry.

That outrage is justified, particularly when American taxpayers are footing the bill.\n\nOur capitalist system works best when there is transparency and accountability. There has been too little of both on Wall Street.\n\nInevitably, the president and Congress are now attempting to respond to taxpayer anger and restore some \"common sense,\" as President Obama recently declared, to CEO compensation. The proposed solution caps top executive pay at $500,000 for institutions that have received bailout money.\n\nI don't think this is the answer, although it is an understandable reaction. It's arbitrary: Why not $400,000 or $600,000? It's incomplete. It only applies to institutions that will receive more government assistance going forward. And it doesn't strengthen our economy when government decides how much each job is worth. In America we leave that job to markets.\n\nSo what's the answer? To strengthen transparency, all aspects of CEO pay and perks should be fully disclosed on a regular basis. This should include airplanes, cars, golf-club memberships, bonuses, stock options, retirement plans and salaries -- in short everything that a common-sense person would consider part of a CEO reward package. See Fiorina discuss exec pay, including her own »\n\nTo strengthen accountability, all aspects of CEO compensation should be voted on by shareholders on an annual basis.\n\nUltimately, it is the owners of a company who must determine whether a CEO's rewards are justified by a CEO's performance. And because the American taxpayer is now a partial owner in many companies, the government can get a vote as well -- in some cases a very sizeable vote.\n\nIn addition, \"clawback provisions,\" which require a CEO to return compensation to shareholders if promised results aren't delivered, should be standard fare.\n\nFinally, when a company comes to Washington for American taxpayer money, it is an admission that mistakes have been made and major bets have failed. These CEOs should be prepared to tender their resignations and those of their boards. To earn a bailout, a CEO and board should be held accountable.\n\nWe should not weaken our economy while trying to fix it. These are difficult times. President Obama has described our current situation as a \"crisis\" and an impending \"catastrophe.\" In such times, action is required. The key is to take actions that help in the short-term, while also being sensible for the medium and long-term.\n\nToo often our politicians react to crisis and public anger by over-reaching, and they create new, unforeseen problems that only become clear with the passage of time.\n\nIn this country, the opportunity to be rewarded for taking prudent risk is fundamental to our economic vitality and strength.

{"ideal": ["melanoma"], "context": "LONDON, England  -- A new drug for melanoma has been shown to rapidly shrink malignant tumors in an early trial at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York.\n\nNew drug inhibits BRAF, the main driver of mutation in over 50 percent of melanomas.\n\nAmong 27 patients whom the experimental new drug was tested on, \"19 showed a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size,\" Dr. Paul Chapman, the lead researcher told CNN from a cancer conference in Berlin.\n\nMelanoma develops in cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, and is the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nCurrently the standard treatment for metastatic malignant melanoma is chemotherapy, which has only a 15 percent success rate, Chapman explained. In his trial using PLX4032 over 70 percent of patients had a response to the drug.\n\n\"Without reservation we can say this is a breakthrough in melanoma. We haven't seen a major breakthrough in this disease in the last 40 years,\" said Professor Alexander Eggermont, President of the European Cancer Organization.\n\nSeventy-five percent of the patients who were treated with PLX4032 had already received multiple treatments of other cancer drugs, all of which had failed. Two-thirds of those patients also already had what Eggermont described as \"very widespread metastatic disease.\"\n\n\"There were patients who were on oxygen or on continuous morphine who were off the morphine after one or two weeks of treatment,\" Eggermont told CNN. Two patients, he said, even showed complete remission, such that all detectable melanoma \"melted away.\"\n\nThe other two major benefits of PLX4032 are that it can be taken orally as a pill and seems to have very mild side effects.\n\nThe PLX4032 complex works by blocking the activity of cancer-causing mutation of the BRAF gene, which is implicated in more than half of all melanomas. Eggermont praised the drug for being highly-selective unlike traditional \"dirty\" cancer drugs that have a wide range of side-effects.\n\n\"The side effect profile looks very mild and we think it's because it's such a clean, super selective molecule and it's an oral drug, and that's a great asset,\" he said.\n\nPeter Hirth, CEO of the drug's maker Plexxikon explained that it is because PLX4032 is such a highly selective compound that \"doctors can adjust the dosage to really shut down tumors,\" whereas other cancer treatment drugs are frequently limited from working to their full potential because patients cannot tolerate their toxicity levels.\n\nPLX4032 is not a cure, but offers hope for alleviating symptoms and extending life.\n\n\"I've never seen this before in melanoma,\" Chapman said referring to the successful findings. \"One thing we don't know is how long these response are going to last,\" he added.\n\nThe next step will now be to test the drug in a larger trial of almost 700 people, scheduled to begin this month and to be completed by the end of the year.\n\nThen a randomized test comparing chemotherapy treatment with PLX4032 therapy will need to occur before. Currently that is slated to take place across North American, Europe and Australia in the first quarter of 2010.\n\n\"We are working to make sure that within the shortest time possible we will satisfy the needs of FDA to get this drug available to melanoma patients as quickly as possible,\" Eggermont said.\n\nEarly responses from peers have been supportive. In a statement Dr. Kat Arney said that \"Cancer Research UK and others have been investigating drugs that can block faulty BRAF, so it is interesting to see the results from a small-scale trial of such a drug. Melanoma is a very difficult cancer to treat and the results of this early-stage trial are promising, but larger trials need to be done before we know for sure how effective this treatment is.\"", "question": "What is the treatment for?"}

It is part of a raft of reforms Sarkozy has pushed for since becoming president.\n\nWhile the change is significant, it is not as much as the government originally hoped because Sarkozy had to deal with opposition from both the left and the right.\n\nSocialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays.\n\nMembers of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day.\n\nIf approved by the Senate, the law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called \"exceptional commercial\" centers near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles, and Lille.\n\nAdditionally, 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas, which already allow some economic activity on Sundays.\n\nThe new law will, among other things, straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores managed to obtain exceptions from the old law and others didn't, and where some stores found it made more sense financially to accept fines for breaking the old law because the income from Sunday sales more than made up for the penalties.\n\nThe measure passed the National Assembly last Tuesday by a vote of 282 to 238.

It said it is looking further at the best way to repair the problem.\n\nOn Thursday, Ford announced that it was changing the software in the braking system for its Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids to correct an occasion glitch in the old software. Ford said no injuries had been reported involving the problem.\n\nThe Fusion/Milan's issue seemed less serious than that of the Prius, said David Champion, the head of auto testing at Consumer Reports.\n\nThe NHTSA investigation involves only 2010 model year Prius hybrids, which went on sale in the middle of last year. There are only 37,000 of those vehicles on the road, according to the agency.\n\nThe Prius, which is built in Japan, is not one of the eight models affected by two recent recalls -- covering several million vehicles -- to fix problems with sticking gas pedals. All of those models were built at North American plants.\n\nNHTSA said its Office of Defects investigation has received 124 reports from consumers about problems with the Prius brakes, including four reports that involved crashes and two that resulted in injuries. No fatalities have been reported. Investigators have spoken with consumers and conducted preliminary field work.\n\nLate Wednesday, Toyota President Akio Toyoda spoke with U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, reassuring him that Toyota takes U.S. safety concerns seriously and puts safety at the top of the company's priorities, according to NHTSA's statement.\n\nToyota had only limited comment on the probe.\n\n\"We have heard about NHTSA's intention to begin an investigation. Toyota will cooperate fully with NHTSA's investigation,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nEven if the solution ends up being a relatively simple and inexpensive software adjustment, the Prius braking problems come at a bad time for Toyota, which has seen its prized reputation for quality and safety badly damaged by the recalls and the news attention given to them.\n\nThe company has estimated that the problem with the gas pedals will cost it about 100,000 sales this year and $2 billion in repair costs and lost revenue.\n\nOther experts say the problem could be more long-lasting if consumers who once trusted the Toyota brand decide to shop elsewhere.\n\nThe Prius problem is a \"disconnect\" in the vehicle's complex anti-lock brake system that causes less than a one-second lag before the brakes start to work, Toyota said Thursday. At 60 mph, though, a vehicle will have traveled nearly another 90 feet before the brakes begin to take hold.\n\nThe company also said it changed the braking system software in January for vehicles built since then.

It was her own pregnancy and the birth of her son that pushed her into a life of activism.\n\n\"They (mothers) only resort to some actions, some practices to try to help the girl,\" said Taku. \"It's better to talk to your daughter -- that's why we teach the mothers even things like puberty.\"\n\n\"The mothers are ignorant, they don't know how to approach their daughters,\" she added.\n\nWith the help of sponsors, the association produces television and print campaigns urging Cameroonian girls to find their voice and confront their mothers.\n\nMalawi's 'Florence Nightingale' saving babies and mothers\n\nWorkshops are also held to educate women about reproductive health. The idea is that when they graduate they'll become trusted sources of information for other Cameroonian girls.\n\nOne workshop participant, Terisia, became pregnant aged 15. Her mother ironed her breasts when she was just nine years old.\n\nTerisia believes she might not have become pregnant so young if her mother had talked to her about sex instead.\n\n\"The advice could have worked better than pressing the breasts,\" Terisia said. \"Sitting with the child, giving the child advice, telling her to prevent sexual intercourse, or if you want to have (sex) you should protect yourself.\"\n\nBut like other mothers, Terisia's mother Grace says she ironed her daughter's breasts to stop boys looking at her.\n\n\"If you ask mothers who are doing breast ironing on their daughters, they will tell you that, 'no I'm doing it because I want to help her, I want to protect her from men,'\" said Taku.\n\nAmong those working for the Association of Aunties is a former victim of breast ironing who says she regrets not speaking out about what was happening to her.\n\nCathy Aba now hopes to save other girls by confronting mothers about the effects of their actions.\n\n\"It's not easy to approach mothers who are involved in the practice of breast ironing,\" she said. \"They consider it a cultural practice. 'My grandmother did it to me,' they tell us.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old still has painful scars, 14 years after her breasts were ironed. Her doctor says surgery is no longer an option.\n\n\"When you finally pass the message to them, they finally accept and decide to never do it again,\" Aba added.\n\nThe campaign group says former victims like Aba really drive home its message.\n\n\"Our victims help us a lot because they talk to mothers; they make the mothers understand that they suffered from this practice,\" Taku said.\n\n\"Even though they had the breasts ironed they grew up ignorant when it came to pregnancy, HIV and other sexual diseases because the mothers were not talking with them.\"", "question": "who is educating about sexual health?"}

He holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe law enforcement source familiar with the case said a DNA swab was taken by court order from Laurean after he was extradited from Mexico in March to face charges in North Carolina. Mexican authorities agreed to the extradition, in part because prosecutors took the death penalty off the table.

So at this stage, they don't want to announce there is any electronic problem.\"\n\nBut according to Pecht, who is an expert in failure analysis and has written a book on sudden acceleration in automobiles, complicated electronics -- not a mechanical issue with the gas pedal -- lie at the heart of Toyota's problems. And three other independent safety analysts contacted by CNN also conclude that neither floor mats nor stuck gas pedals are an overwhelming issue.\n\n\"From what people have told me about their sudden acceleration incidents, most of them have have got nothing to do with the sticking pedal at all,\" said Antony Anderson, an electronics consultant in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.\n\nAnderson said electronic throttle controls, which largely have replaced mechanical accelerators, can malfunction in ways he compared to an occasionally disobedient child.\n\n\"We've all had that type of experience, and I'm afraid that is the sort of experience that can happen with any piece of electronics, with an electronic throttle,\" he said.\n\nAnd Sean Kane, who runs a company called Safety Research Strategies in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, said, \"Toyota's explanations do not account for the share of unintended acceleration complaints that we have examined.\"\n\nToyota officials dispute any assertion that the complicated array of electronics in its cars has an impact on the acceleration issues that have dominated headlines in the past weeks.\n\n\"After many years of exhaustive testing by us and by other organizations, we have found no evidence of an electronic problem in our electronic throttle control systems that could have led to unwanted acceleration,\" said John Hanson, Toyota's spokesman on quality-control issues.\n\nBut experts like Anderson say the tests conducted by Toyota are not adequate.\n\n\"Those tests do not reproduce what actually happens in everyday life,\" Anderson said. \"They are testing for certain conditions, for certain standards, but they test, for example, signals one at a time. They don't do a whole lot of signals altogether. Whereas in a car, you've got a great cacophony of electromagnetic interference going on all the time, and you really can't rely on testing of a single frequency at one time.\"\n\nAs for the U.S. government's testing of Toyota's problems, the man in charge of the Center For Auto Safety, Clarence Ditlow, said that a 2007 test on a Lexus -- a Toyota brand -- by the National Highway Safety and Traffic Administration to find possible electronic interference was amateurish.\n\n\"They didn't do any real testing,\" he said. \"For all I know, they just took a garage door opener, pointed it at the engine compartment and snapped it, and that's electronic interference to see whether or not anything happened.

It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein.\n\nNow, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work.\n\n\"It is difficult because of the destruction,\" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. \"This facility was bombed in 1991.

Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility.\n\nDespite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004. It accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait left it facing an international military coalition that ultimately drove out the Iraqi forces.\n\nThe bombardment that accompanied the 1991 war inflicted extensive damage to the Tuwaitha plants. The U.N. sanctions and inspections imposed after 1991 forced Hussein's government to abandon its nuclear program, the ISG concluded.\n\nAfter the 2003 invasion, which was launched after the United States incorrectly accused Iraq of having restarted its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, nearby Iraqis inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility. Villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness, particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water.\n\nThe Iraq Survey Group found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings, and the U.S. military later spent $70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as \"yellowcake\" -- to Canada.\n\nSome Iraqi scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future.

I beg you, let her go! I beg you not to throw her in the midst of your political games! She is too weak and too pure to take part in your games. Let me be present at her trial, sit next to her wise father and gentle mother, and testify she is without guilt or reproach.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old filmmaker said that Saberi was planning to leave the country, but he kept her from leaving until his latest film -- which will be shown at this year's Cannes film festival -- was completed.\n\nGhobadi won the 2000 Golden Camera award at the Cannes festival for his feature film, \"A Time for Drunken Horses.\"\n\nSaberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public. The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials.\n\nIranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage.\n\nSaberi's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair.\n\nGhobadi wrote that he is \"optimistic about her release, and I firmly hope the verdict will be canceled in the next stage of the trial.\"\n\n\"My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID, is in jail.

Philip Garrido claimed it could speak his thoughts.\n\n\"He feels he can speak to you and me and everyone else using this box,\" said Garrido's friend and former business client, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"He was a whack job, but he was a whack job who sounded like he had a really good heart,\" the friend added.\n\nGarrido and his wife, Nancy, were arrested last month and charged on more than two dozen counts, including kidnapping and rape.\n\nAuthorities say the Garridos held Jaycee Dugard, 29, captive for nearly two decades in their backyard. Both have pleaded not guilty. Authorities have said Garrido, a registered sex offender, fathered Dugard's two children.\n\nA few days before his arrest, Garrido delivered some documents touting the device to the FBI.\n\nThe black box is simple, with a handle, a metal switch and jacks for plugging in headphones. But it provides some insight into the mind of 58-year-old Garrido.\n\nGarrido told his friend and customers of his printing business that the box allowed him to communicate without speaking.\n\n\"He would move his lips and not speak ... and you would be able to hear his voice through the headphones,\" the friend said.\n\nThree years ago, Garrido demonstrated the box for clients of his printing business. The clients, some of them at least, went along with his claims for the device.\n\n\"I didn't want to tell him you're a kook and you don't know what you're talking about,\" said Tim Allen, who owns a glass shop in Antioch.\n\nEven so, Allen and several other former Garrido clients signed declarations saying the device worked.\n\n\"People believe in things. I didn't think it was my place to shoot him down,\" Allen said.\n\nGarrido so believed in the power of his invention that he wanted to have the device patented, so he solicited the help of a private investigator last year.\n\n\"He was speaking normal, dressed normal, acting normal,\" said Ralph Hernandez, who spent 30 years in law enforcement before becoming an independent private investigator.\n\nHernandez said he agreed to help Garrido verify the testimonials that the product actually worked, but he never saw the box. Garrido told him it would be best if he didn't, the investigator said.\n\nHernandez said he provided all the requested information to Garrido.\n\n\"This was like the last part before he would take whatever he had had to a lawyer to prepare for patenting,\" Hernandez said.\n\nDocuments obtained by CNN include a news release that Garrido produced:\n\n\"A Bay area man has made a major discovery concerning the phenomenon of voice,\" the release says, accompanied by a photograph of Garrido. Read the news release\n\nThough it's not known whether Garrido hired a patent attorney, there's no record at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of a patent application or a patent granted to him. But 48 hours before he was arrested, Garrido gave the device to his friend for safekeeping.\n\n\"I can only guess that he knew something bad was going to happen,'' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, investigators will begin excavating part of the Garridos' California property Monday afternoon after two sheriff's dogs trained to find human remains alerted authorities of possible buried bones, officials said.\n\nThe search is in the same area as a canine alert last week, said Lt.
