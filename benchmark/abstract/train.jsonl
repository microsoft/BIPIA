Dan (Evans) and James (Ward) will continue to improve and we've got the makings of a very solid team.\"\nAfter breaking Dodig, 28, in the first game of their match, Murray was pegged back to 2-2 before immediately breaking again.\nFrom then on, the Scot dictated play to win the first set in 47 minutes before rattling through the second with a double break.\nThe match ended amid controversy when a Dodig winner, which would have given him a break point, was overruled by the umpire after Murray pointed to a mark on the clay.\nThe home crowd booed as Murray won the ensuing match point before celebrating on court with his team-mates.\n\"I thought it was a pretty good match. I gave him very few opportunities on my serve,\" added Murray.\n\"Murray had a steely look in his eye from the very first point, and by breaking Dodig's serve in the very first game, drained what little self-belief Croatia's number one had taken into the match.\n\"The first set was a contest, but Murray was a class apart, and had the ability to break Dodig's serve at regular intervals.\n\"Britain have come a long way under captain Leon Smith, and with Murray indicating his enthusiasm to play in the World Group if fit, an exciting opportunity lies ahead.\"\n\"It got pretty hostile towards the end. It was good to go through in that kind of atmosphere. You don't see that much in Grand Slam matches, and it is good for character-building.\n\"The thing is, when the crowds get like that you have to tell yourself it's because they are frustrated that their team is losing. I managed to stay cool at the end.\"\nLooking ahead to the draw, Murray said: \"I would just like a home tie, in a big arena, against one of the top teams.\n\"It is an incredibly difficult competition to win because some of the teams have so much depth. It depends on the ties and whether you are at home.\n\"We could easily draw Spain away in the first round and that would be an ugly match-up for us - very difficult to win.\n\"But it's possible to go deep into the competition. Let's enjoy this just now and wait and see the draw on Wednesday.\"\nCaptain Smith, who has won seven of his eight ties since his appointment in 2010, paid tribute to Murray's role in the success.\n\"Andy is such a good player and so experienced,\" said Smith. \"I did not have to say much, so it was more putting an ice towel round his neck.\n\"It was more about knowing when to say things, rather than just blurting things. Everyone has played a big part in this, and I hope that everyone has bought into the team spirit.\""}

Like the BBC, it was funded mainly by licence fees.\nIn 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government announced that the IBA would be replaced with a new public broadcaster that would be less costly.\nOpponents expressed concern that Mr Netanyahu, who has accused IBA journalists of being overly critical of his right-wing coalition, wanted to control the media.\nThe setting up of Kan was delayed repeatedly and almost abandoned in March.\nMr Netanyahu reportedly wanted it scrapped because he was concerned that two officials appointed to senior positions in the new broadcaster were left-leaning. However, the leader of another party in his coalition, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, insisted on pressing ahead.\nThe dispute, which almost led to an early general election being called, was resolved after it was agreed that the two officials would not oversee news.\nAlthough they were aware that Kan was scheduled to launch next week, IBA employees had not expected TV and radio broadcasts to cease on Tuesday night.\n\"We thought of parting a bit differently than this,\" Michal Rabinovich, the lead presenter of Mabat LaHadashot told viewers.\nCommentator Yaakov Ahimeir called it \"a mark of disgrace on this government\", adding: \"They notify you two hours before going on air that this is the last Mabat.

They contain only a tiny fraction of our genetic material, with the bulk that determines things like our hair and eye colour housed in the nucleus - a speck in the yolk if you use the hen's egg analogy.\nScientists have been studying two ways of creating three person embryos.\nOne way is to take the nucleus from the mother's egg and put it into a donor egg that has healthy mitochondria and has had its own nucleus removed. This new egg can then be fertilised with the father's sperm.\nAnother way is to fertilise the mother's egg first before removing the nucleus and putting it into the donor egg.\nThe latest study looked at the first method.\nThe Oregon Health team took eggs from seven women who had volunteered to take part in the research.\nBy Fergus WalshMedical correspondent\nThe scientists were able to replace the mitochondrial DNA in 65 of the eggs and then looked to see how well these fared over the next week or so.\nThe fertilisation rate afterwards was similar to the 33 control eggs that had not been manipulated, although over half had abnormal qualities.\nThose that did fertilise normally developed to blastocyst stage - five or six days later, the point at which IVF embryos are normally transferred into the mother's womb - at a similar rate to the controls.\nDr Masahito Tachibana and colleagues say their research shows that the technique can work, at least in the lab. It is still not clear if it could lead to a healthy baby.\nThe scientists now want to be able to do more studies to ensure the treatment is also safe.\nUK expert Prof Mary Herbert, of Newcastle University, has also been studying three person IVF, but using the other method which takes the nucleus out of an already fertilised egg.\nShe called the latest findings \"encouraging\" and said they were further proof that the concept was sound, although she believes the technique she uses will provide better results.\nBefore either method could be used to help couples have a healthy baby in the UK, the government would need to give its approval and any clinic would need to obtain a license from the regulator - the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).

{"ideal": "Children with autism might miss out on non-verbal aspects of conversation as they look away when speaking to adults, scientists found.", "context": "They say that adults should be aware of this when communicating with children with autism.\nIn a presentation at the British Science Association, the team said it could be one of the reasons they struggle with social interaction.\nThe work is published in the journal Developmental Science.\nResearchers from Durham and Northumbria Universities found that people tend to look at others when talking to them, but look away when thinking.\nThe team studied children with autism, and those with Williams syndrome, as well as healthy children at a similar level of development and intelligence.\nWilliams syndrome is a genetic disorder, and much rarer than autism, with about one in 20,000 children suffering from it.\nIt is often considered to be the polar opposite of autism, with sufferers being hyper-social, seeking out interactions with known adults and strangers. They are also often very empathetic and outgoing children.\nAlthough children with both these disorders behave very differently in terms of eye contact with people they're talking to, they and the healthy children assessed all tended to break eye contact and look away when they were thinking or remembering.\nTo investigate why this might be, the researchers asked children to perform maths problems, either without instruction, or while being told to maintain eye contact with the experimenter.\nSource: NHS Choices\nWhat is autism?\nAll children, whether they were autistic, had Williams syndrome, or were healthy controls, made more errors when they were forced to look at the person asking the questions while they answered them.\nThe researchers concluded that holding eye contact is mentally demanding, so looking away while thinking is therefore beneficial when doing difficult tasks such as solving maths problems.\nDebbie Riby, the lead author on the paper, thought this was an important message to present to teachers and other people who work with children.\nShe said: \"One of the really important things for teachers to be aware of is that we shouldn't expect children to keep looking at us, when they're trying to think. And that goes for a teacher of a typically developing child, a child with autism or a child with Williams syndrome.\n\"If teachers work with pupils with autism, they also need to be aware that these children might be missing important non-verbal cues. We could encourage them to look at us when they're listening, but we shouldn't get that mixed up with when they're thinking.\"\nThe researchers were surprised that children with Williams syndrome looked away when they were thinking, as they often stare at people when talking to them, so researchers had wondered whether they wouldn't avert gaze when thinking.\n\"Eye-tracking studies have shown that they stare or use prolonged fixations towards people, and faces. We thought they would show what we term 'sticky fixation' on faces, and struggle to disengage from them, but actually the children we studied in these tasks need to look away when they're thinking as well.\n\"We expected that they wouldn't have as much of a drop in performance when they were forced to maintain eye contact, but actually they still needed to look away when they think.\"\nWhen talking and listening, people get cues from areas other than speech, that autistic children might be missing. But Dr Riby was keen to point out that children with Williams syndrome, despite paying a great deal of attention to faces, aren't expert communicators.\n\"Looking for too long is as dysfunctional as not looking for long enough. Children with Williams syndrome are not expert face processors. It means they're not naturally allocating their attention to everything around them,\" she explained.\nBut how easy is it to tell whether a pupil in class is daydreaming, or trying to work something out?\n\"If the pupil seems to be on-task and they do seem to be processing information, you can tell they're working it out. If they have lost attention, they might still look at you, but through you,\" Dr Riby told the BBC.\nIn their interactive session at the science festival, Dr Riby asked an adult volunteer in the audience to answer some maths problems.\n\"As soon as we asked him a hard question he averted his gaze, it's easy to show,\" he said."}

Once I got going today, I was moving well and I finished strong.\"\nAny major celebrations will have to wait as Murray heads to the airport and a 16-hour flight to Los Angeles, with the Indian Wells Masters getting under way next week.\nMurray, who will play his first match in the Californian desert next weekend, hopes to improve on a relatively modest record of just one final appearance back in 2009.\nLast year, he lost in the third round at both Indian Wells and two weeks later at the Miami Masters.\n\"I struggled at Indian Wells and Miami last year, I didn't play so well,\" he said. \"This year has given me great momentum.\"\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\nDespite dropping his opening two service games, this turned into a straightforward win for Murray.\nA first title of 2017 takes Murray over 2,000 points clear of Novak Djokovic at the top of the world rankings, and means he is extremely unlikely to be overtaken by anyone until at least the French Open.\nMurray's form in Dubai this week suggests not only has he got over his bout of shingles, but also that the defeat to Mischa Zverev at the Australian Open is no indication of a deeper malaise."}

In the Wales against Ireland match in Cardiff, Ireland carried a substantial 415 metres, but only scored 16 points. This is a problem that needs addressing, according to Mallett.\n\"You have to create try-scoring opportunities, which northern hemisphere teams haven't done,\" he said.\n\"Ireland against Wales in the Six Nations last year, I remember clearly a period when Ireland hammered away around the fringes with their wide players completely and utterly unmarked. You would never see New Zealand making that mistake.\"\nHowever, Mallett does feel northern hemisphere sides have the potential to match their southern counterparts.\n\"Weather really makes a massive difference to how you play the game, but if you go in with a positive intent - as all the teams did on the final weekend of the Six Nations last year - then we can see northern hemisphere sides playing the same style as southern hemisphere teams, and being more of a challenge to those teams at the next World Cup.\"\nMallett was beaten to the England job by Stuart Lancaster in 2012, and was again approached by the RFU before Eddie Jones was appointed as Lancaster's successor.\nMallett continued: \"The RFU chose Stuart Lancaster for very good reasons, they felt he understood England and understood the team and they wanted to give an England coach an opportunity.\n\"I've said all along I would have loved to have had the opportunity because I had [former All Blacks coach] Wayne Smith who was keen to do it with me.\"\nWith Smith currently taking a sabbatical from coaching, Mallett declared himself unavailable this time round, with Eddie Jones appointed to the role in November.\n\"It's interesting to see now how England went quickly for an experienced international coach,\" Mallett added.\n\"I think he will do well, he's certainly entertaining. Eddie Jones has had success, but he's also had poor stints. Every coach has his ups and downs and there are no guarantees.\"\nHowever, the South African believes England will finally be crowned Six Nations champions in 2016, if they can prevail at Murrayfield on the opening weekend.\n\"If England beat Scotland, they have Italy and then two games at home. I'm predicting England will be the strongest side, because of the draw and the enthusiasm which a new captain and coach brings,\" he said.\nHear more from Nick Mallett on 5 live Sport's Six Nations preview, Thursday evening from 19:00 GMT.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter or sign up to the new  rugby alerts service available on the BBC Sport app."}

{"ideal": "Eurozone leaders have reached agreement over a third Greek bailout after marathon talks in Brussels.", "context": "Greece has won conditional agreement to receive up to €86bn (£61bn; $95bn) over three years, although this is not yet in the bag.\nBut it has had to make substantial concessions in return - and the consequences for the Greek economy look set to be far-reaching.\nWhat are the main areas of economic reform stipulated by the deal?\nIn a nutshell: taxation, pensions, the labour markets, banks and privatisation.\nPrivatisation has been a key sticking point in all this. How is that \"improved governance\" going to be achieved?\nThis is one of the most far-reaching aspects of the deal. The text of the summit statement says: \"Valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetise the assets through privatisations and other means.\"\nIt says the fund will be established in Greece and managed by the Greek authorities, but \"under the supervision of the relevant European institutions\" - that is, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, which, along with the International Monetary Fund, have been supervising Greek finances throughout the crisis.\nIn effect, this is being seen as a trust fund outside the control of the Greek government, which can cherry-pick Greek assets and dispose of them in order to repay the country's debts.\nThe summit document quotes a figure of €50bn for the value of the fund. Of that, half will go towards recapitalising the country's cash-strapped banks, whose health - or lack of it - has been so much under scrutiny in recent months.\nA quarter of the proceeds of the fund will be used for reducing Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio, while the remaining €12.5bn will be used for investments in Greece.\nDoes all this mean that Greece is rescued?\nAs far as eurozone leaders are concerned, these conditions are necessary, but not sufficient, and they will not tolerate any backsliding.\nAs their statement says: \"The above-listed commitments are minimum requirements to start the negotiations with the Greek authorities. However, the euro summit made clear that the start of negotiations does not preclude any final possible agreement on a new ESM programme.\"\nThe ESM is the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone's rescue fund. The document says that the summit \"takes note of the possible programme financing needs of between €82bn and €86bn\".\nIt also \"takes note\" of Greece's \"urgent financing needs\" of €7bn by 20 July and another €5bn by the middle of August.\nYou might wish to take note of the fact that so far, the EU has not yet firmly undertaken to pay out one cent to Greece.\nFor now, everything hinges on whether Greece's leftist Syriza government can get this package approved by the country's parliament.\nBy Wednesday night, Greek MPs have to vote on a raft of measures covering the VAT increases, the pension changes, the independence of the country's national statistics institute and commitments to \"fiscal consolidation\".\nOnly then can final agreement on the latest bailout be reached.\nMany people believe that Greece's debt burden can never be repaid and that austerity is only making things worse. Is there any support for that view in the summit document?\nNone whatsoever. The text says that \"the euro summit stresses that nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken\" - in other words, eurozone leaders have no intention of unilaterally reducing the amount that Greece owes.\nIn 2011, Greece's private lenders took a massive 50% haircut on what they were owed, reducing Greece's debt by €100bn. Greece pushed for a second debt haircut this year, but has failed to reach an agreement with its creditors.\nAnd the Greek government seems to have accepted that a second haircut is not going to happen, since the document says that \"the Greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to their creditors fully and in a timely manner\"."}

{"ideal": "In politics - as in other walks of life - it pays to trust your instincts.", "context": "In 2010, Peter Robinson's instincts told him not to stand in the general election. He ignored them - and lost.\nIt was a mistake he was unlikely to make again when it came to his other jobs as first minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe \"why now\" question is easy.\nFirstly, the East Belfast seat was recaptured in May, even though it took a unionist pact to allow Gavin Robinson (no relation) to defeat Alliance's Naomi Long.\nSecondly, Tuesday's Fresh Start deal with Sinn FÃ©in offers some stability to the Stormont institutions after a year of uncertainty.\nCertainly it should stave off fears of an early assembly election - which the DUP did not want - and allows the new leadership team time to get bedded in ahead of the poll which will now take place as planned in May.\nAnd last but not least, it allows Mr Robinson his valedictory moment at the DUP conference this weekend.\nThe decision to announce his departure ahead of the conference takes the edge off the event and makes it more of a lap of honour.\nThere was never much chance of Mr Robinson leading his party into the assembly election in any case.\nThe past few years, both personally and professionally, have been turbulent for the 66-year-old leader.\nHe has faced the trauma of his wife Iris's break-down and affair with a much younger man; and he faced major health problems, suffering a heart attack earlier this year.\nThe way he dealt with both of those issues garnered widespread admiration.\nBut there has been less admiration for the way he dealt with Stormont's most recent crisis, and, in particular, the rolling resignation policy of DUP ministers which was much criticised.\nMr Robinson, however, may say it was better than the alternative - pulling down the institutions altogether.\nHe has also had to deny allegations he was to benefit financially as a result of Northern Ireland's biggest ever property deal involving the Republic's so-called bad bank, Nama (National Assets Management Agency).\nIf any of this caused rumblings behind the scenes none of it broke the surface of a party which Mr Robinson leaves as tightly disciplined as it was when he joined it.\nBut it is bound to have caused disquiet and made some members wonder if the party might be safer to enter the assembly election under new leadership.\nCertainly it will be difficult for the DUP to match its result last time when they were generally felt to have over-achieved by returning with 38 MLAs.\nAdd to that signs of resurgence in the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and there may never be a better time for Mr Robinson to bow out.\nNevertheless, his unrivalled ability as a master strategist is still likely to be missed, whoever takes over.\nJust as his departure is not a surprise, neither will it be a shock if he is replaced by Nigel Dodds as party leader and by Arlene Foster as first minister.\nAfter all she has had on-the-job training when Mr Robinson stepped aside to deal with his personal problems and recently over allegations of IRA involvement in the murder of Kevin McGuigan.\nHis legacy may be two-fold. The transformation of the DUP from a minority party of protest into a vote-winning machine which trampled all before it in the crowded electoral world of unionism.\nAnd secondly his transformation from the hardliner who once led a loyalist \"invasion\" of the County Monaghan village of Clontibret into the pragmatist who came to terms with - and set the terms for - going into government with Sinn FÃ©in.\nNeither of these achievements is likely to make him any more loved by his many detractors but should surely secure him a significant place in the pantheon of unionist leaders."}

Many Greeks facing even more austerity - pension cuts and tax rises - might not care much about whether that happens or not. But missing the July deadline would mean more financial turbulence and further delays before the rest of the eurozone would be ready to talk about additional debt relief. The IMF insists that's essential if the debt is to be made sustainable.  But it won't be in the form of a reduction of the principal sum that Greece owes.

We had to go for a young player, for a left-footed player and for a fast player - especially who is fast in the space because most of my attacking players are fast and fast with the ball.\n\"Salah is a kind of player that looks for the space and tries to get behind people so we think he was a good choice.\"\nAfter starting his career at Egyptian side El Mokawloon, Salah moved to Basel in 2012 and scored five league goals in 29 appearances as they secured a fourth league title in as many seasons.\nHis form this season has helped Basel to top spot in their domestic league ahead of its resumption after a winter break.\nSalah, who made his Egypt debut in 2011, finished as joint-top goalscorer in Africa's World Cup qualifying groups with six goals.\nHe was, however, unable to help his country to Brazil 2014 as they were beaten over two legs by Ghana in a play-off."}

The answer is no - but it comes pretty darn close.\nBoyle's masterstroke is to tackle the passing of time head-on. Where the characters in the original film were blissfully insouciant about their self-destructive hedonism, they are here all too aware of the cul-de-sacs and dead ends at which they've now arrived.\nThey are, to quote T2's most striking line, \"tourists in their own youth\": a description that applies just as much to the audience member who goes to the film hoping to have the same giddy high they experienced two decades ago.\nWhat we get instead is something altogether richer and more poignant: a love letter to the boundless promise of youth, tinged with the regret of mistakes made and decisions untaken.\nThe mix of old and new extends to the film's depiction of Edinburgh, a fast-moving blur of sleek trams and posh shops that is a world removed from the shabby, heroin-ravaged dystopia we saw in the original.\nTrainspotting arrived at a brief moment in British politics and culture that was infused with energy and optimism. Its follow-up reflects the Britain of today: a divided nation plagued by uncertainty.\nIt's not a complete downer though, scenes involving bodily fluids, casual violence and incompetent housebreaking providing uproariously funny punctuation to the generally melancholy mood.\nT2 Trainspotting won't leave you floating on air.

Although there was no control group in this study, the researchers said the results showed a five to 20% improvement on previous studies of prostate cancer treatment.\nAnd cancer biopsy tests performed two years after the trial were found to be negative in 83% and 79% of the patients in the two groups.\nDr Brian Butler, from Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas, said it could change the way that cancer is treated.\n\"We may be able to inject the agent straight into the tumour and let the body kill the cancer cells.\n\"Once the immune system has knowledge of the bad tumour cells, if they pop up again, the body will know to kill them.\"\nKevin Harrington, professor of biological cancer therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said the results were \"very interesting\" but more research was needed.\n\"We would need a randomised trial to tell if this treatment is better than radiotherapy alone.\n\"The viruses used in this study cannot reproduce. Next generation viral therapies for cancer can selectively replicate in cancer cells, something that can kill the cancer cell directly, and also help spread the virus to neighbouring cancer cells.\n\"It would be interesting to see this approach used with viruses that could reproduce to see if it makes for a more effective treatment.\""}

The arrests were made in late April, but police only made it public late last week\nMr Yuan told the investigators he  made the  jellyfish by mixing three chemicals - alginic acid, ammonium alum and calcium chloride anhydrous - according to an official release (in Chinese) by Huzhou police on social media platform WeChat.\nOfficers say they found \"excessive levels\" of aluminium in the fake jellyfish - up to 800mg/kg, which is eight times of China's own legal limit.\nThe food and drug safety branch of Huzhou police said too much aluminium could result in bone and nerve damage, and potentially harm memory. They warned against pregnant women, children and the elderly consuming the substance.\nAlthough jellyfish can be poisonous they are considered something of a delicacy in China, described as both tasty and a good source of collagen.\nEspecially popular in the summer, jellyfish skin is sliced and served like a salad with various dressings.\nIt appears as if the wild jellyfish supply simply cannot cope with the demand.  Zhejiang's Metropolitan Express paper has reported on jellyfish farms in the province.  It quotes fish farmers  saying that half-a-kilo of jellyfish takes 40 days to raise, with the wholesale price at about 30-40 yuan.\nThis cost is halved with artificial jellyfish and for obvious reasons, the production time is far less.\nThe Huzhou police have issued guidance on how to spot the difference.\nArtificial jellyfish is tasteless with no smell and is tough to tear and has a texture similar to sellotape.\nThe real deal?  Quite the opposite.  It has a fishy smell, and is yellowish and colourful.\nIn November 2014, Huzhou police, again, caught three individuals selling fake jellyfish made from a similar chemical mixture.\nIn October 2013, police in central Hunan province broke another jellyfish syndicate.\nThat group is said to have made 40 tonnes of fake jellyfish, and the ringleader was sentenced to six months in jail."}

They will argue that it, along with other oversight reports, clears them of carrying out \"mass surveillance\" as their critics have claimed.\nThey have argued that the way they collect and then examine material is compliant with human rights obligations and the law. A central point of contention has been whether bulk access to traffic through cable taps was in itself a violation of privacy because of what it swept up. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) says that indiscriminate trawling for information would be unlawful but the way in which the intelligence agencies go about selecting and retaining material is proportionate and lawful.\nThose who brought the case will not give up - they will go to Strasbourg and the European court and have also raised questions about the IPT process itself. But they will be disappointed by today's ruling even if it did not come as a complete surprise.\nThe bodies bringing the case to tribunal argued that GCHQ's methods breached article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the right to privacy, as well as article 10, which protects freedom of expression.\nBut the judges at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) said the disclosures made during this case, which included the legal footing of the intelligence system's activities, had contributed to their decision that the intelligence agencies were not in breach of human rights.\nIn a written judgment, a panel of IPT judges said: \"We have been able to satisfy ourselves that as of today there is no contravention of articles 8 and 10 by reference to those systems.\n\"We have left open for further argument the question as to whether prior hereto there has been a breach.\"\nA government security source told the BBC: \"We are delighted that a third independent body has confirmed that GCHQ does not seek to carry out mass surveillance.\"\nJames Welch, legal director for civil rights organisation Liberty, said: \"So a secretive court thinks that secret safeguards shown to it in secret are an adequate protection of our privacy.\n\"The IPT cannot grasp why so many of us are deeply troubled about GCHQ's Tempora operation - a seemingly unfettered power to rifle through our online communications.\"\nAmnesty UK's legal advisor Rachel Logan said the government had \"managed to bluff their way out of the case\" by \"retreating into closed hearings and constantly playing the 'national security' card\".\n\"We have had to painstakingly drag out every detail we could from an aggressively resistant government.\"\nShe also said the IPT's ruling was a \"disappointing, if unsurprising, verdict from an overseer that was in part assessing itself\".\n\"The government's entire defence has amounted to 'trust us' and now the tribunal has said the same,\" she added.\n\"Since we only know about the scale of such surveillance thanks to Snowden, and given that 'national security' has been recklessly bandied around, 'trust us' isn't enough.\""}

{"ideal": "Drinking lots of alcohol in a short space of time will not only get you drunk but may also upset your heart rhythm, say researchers.", "context": "They did a field experiment in Germany with 3,000 adults at Munich's famous annual Oktoberfest.\nThe odds of heart arrhythmia increased as beer consumption went up.\nMost of the arrhythmias were \"apparently harmless\" sinus tachycardia, where the heart just beats faster than normal, but a few were not.\nAround 5% of the arrhythmias recorded were potentially more worrying, and included one type called atrial fibrillation, which, if it persists, is linked to an increased risk of stroke and heart failure.\nThese odds are very low, which meant there was no significant link between alcohol and dangerous heart arrhythmias in the study.\nBut there was a significant link between alcohol consumption and more benign arrhythmias.\nThe volunteers, who were all deemed sober enough to take part in the tests, had heart traces taken using a mobile phone app while they partied.\nAlthough it is not surprising that heart rate might increase in a party atmosphere, sinus tachycardia was far more common among the drinkers who had downed a few Steins of beer at the Oktoberfest than in the 400 or so abstainers.\nThe likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia increased as the number of grams of alcohol per kilogram of blood (measured with a breathalyser) went up.\nEven though the \"lively atmosphere in the beer tent\" was not the ideal setting for doing the heart traces, the researchers were able to get reliable recordings for almost all of the volunteers, the European Heart Journal reports.\nThey found arrhythmias in 30% of these 30-second recordings - more than would be expected in a general population.\nThe researchers think it is possible that innocent arrhythmias could sometimes lead to more serious ones, such as atrial fibrillation, within days of drinking lots of alcohol, although they did not test this out in their study.\nThey now plan more research to check if this \"Holiday Heart Syndrome\" - arrhythmia triggered by an a sudden alcohol binge - exists and, if it does, whether it remedies itself.\nResearcher Dr Moritz Sinner from the University Hospital of Munich said: \"What we have found is that alcohol does interfere with heart rhythm, which hasn't been shown like this before.\n\"What we still don't know is what happens after people stop drinking or continue to drink. What happens the next day or the day after?\"\nDr Mike Knapton from the British Heart Foundation said: \"Using the Munich Oktoberfest as a real world laboratory is a unique approach and has given us an insight into how heavy drinking over a short space of time can increase people's chances of having an abnormal heart rhythm. However, longer-term follow-up is needed to confirm if this type of drinking has a lasting effect in giving people potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\"Extensive research has shown that alcohol consumption is associated with a range of diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Our advice is to drink in moderation, or no more than 14 units of alcohol per week.\""}

Fresh mutton on flight menu,\" joked Nadeem Farooq Paracha, a Dawn blogger and columnist, in a tweet.\nAnother journalist, Fasi Zaka, tweeted: \"PIA sacrifices a black goat before resuming ATR services, they take their historical nickname 'Please Inform Allah' (PIA) very seriously.\"\nTelevision anchor Ejaz Haider tweeted: \"When Charles Perrow was working on his theory of normal accidents, he totally missed out on 'kala bakra' [black goat] as a hedge against accidents.\"\nMeanwhile, one Twitter user by the name of MisBis spoke for many when she wrote: \"There's nothing wrong in giving Sadqa [sacrificial offering]â€¦ Sadqa bari balao se bachata hai [it hedges against many troubles]â€¦ stop making it a joke\".\nPIA had 11 ATR-42 planes in its fleet - the one that crashed in the Havelian region on 7 December killed all those on board.\nDays later, the pilot of another ATR had to abort take-off due to a malfunction in one of the engines, leading PIA to ground the rest of its ATRs for tests.\nThis affected PIA operations to smaller destinations such as Chitral, Gilgit, Gwadar and many other destinations in Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab where small air strips and lack of technical cover do not allow larger planes to land.\nDid Sunday night's sacrifice help?\nAll we can say is the flight departed safely for Multan, and later returned to Islamabad."}

However, those tests now come under the ban too.\nThe EU Commission says it is working with industry to develop more alternatives to animal testing, and that it allocated 238m euros (Â£208m; $310m) in 2007-2011 for such research.\nCosmetics firms are concerned that the ban could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage in a global market.\nCosmetics Europe chief Bertil Heerink, quoted by the Associated Press news agency, said that \"by implementing the ban at this time, the European Union is jeopardising the industry's ability to innovate\"."}

There is no minister who was ever appointed by the Guptas.\"\nThe speaker ordered opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane to leave the chamber for breaching parliamentary rules, prompting the party's MPs to walk out in solidarity with him.\nEarlier, Mr Maimane said power had shifted from the government to the Guptas.\n\"You and your family are getting richer while South Africans are getting poorer,\" he told Mr Zuma.\nThe party said in a statement that Mr Zuma's position was becoming \"increasingly untenable\", and he should resign or be sacked by the governing party.\nThe left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party boycotted the parliamentary session, saying it did not recognise Mr Zuma as leader of South Africa.\nAnalysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg\nPresident Zuma's simple denial of his toxic relationship with the Gupta family seemed to sum up the view held by many here, that he is not fully engaged in running the country.\n\"Deny, deny, deny\" is the same strategy the 73-year-old employed when he came under fire over the use of government money to upgrade his private home in the rural area of Nkandla - until he was forced to make a U-turn when the opposition took him to South Africa's highest court.\nThe court is yet to make a ruling on whether he breached his oath of office by failing to repay the money, despite an anti-corruption watchdog finding that he had \"unduly benefited\" from the renovations.\nIn parliament, Mr Zuma seemed detached from the crisis gripping South Africa.\nNor did the speaker, a senior member of the governing party, inspire confidence in South Africa's 22-year-old democracy when she threw out opposition leader Mmusi Maimane, as he challenged the president.\nThe opposition has long accused Mr Zuma of letting the Guptas wield excessive influence.\nThe Guptas, who arrived in South Africa from India in 1993, have huge interests in computers, air travel, energy, and technology.\nThey said Mr Jonas' statement was political point-scoring.\nIn 2013, there was an outcry after a private jet carrying guests to the wedding of a Gupta family member was allowed to land at a South African military air force base in Pretoria.\nThe opposition has said that links between President Zuma and the Guptas were so close that they have been nicknamed the \"Zuptas\"."}

If he gets through he will not be home and dry by any means but his fight will then start and he can think about trying to break Haye down.\n\"The one thing against Haye is he's only fought a couple of times since 2012. I think he will solely rely on getting Bellew out early.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHaye has been criticised for graphic descriptions of how he intends to hurt his opponent, while Bellew has actively pursued the fight, calling his foe out publicly from the ring after a routine win in October.\nThe feud has meant both fighters have been kept apart by security in fight week, and the pre-fight face-off was also conducted with people between them.\nBritish Boxing Board of Control general secretary Robert Smith has expressed his disappointment in their behaviour.\n\"When it's all over, they will look back and neither one of them will be proud of beforehand,\" added Woodhall, 48. \"You have to have a balance. We all want the fight to sell but you don't want people pointing the finger at the sport of boxing.\n\"Psychologically, I think Bellew has played a blinder. Haye has to control his emotions early on.

I think Bellew wants Haye to come out very aggressively.\"\nHaye is attempting to improve his record of 28 wins from 30 fights, while Bellew has 28 wins, two losses and one draw on his record.\nThe bitterness between Haye and Bellew has been mirrored by super-lightweight rivals Derry Mathews and Ohara Davies.\nThe pair have engaged in insulting social media exchanges and expletive-laden rants before a bout which is the biggest of Davies' 14-fight career, and could help 33-year-old Mathews keep hopes of another world-title shot alive.\nWoodhall expects the welterweight fight between Sam Eggington and American Paulie Malignaggi to potentially steal the show.\nMalignaggi, 36, has been a world champion at two weights and has shared a ring with stellar names such as Amir Khan, Adrian Broner and Danny Garcia.\nWales' IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby will contest a non-title bout against Spain's Andoni Gago, while Ireland's London 2012 Olympic champion Katie Taylor enters her third fight as a professional when she faces Italy's Monica Gentili, who has six wins and as many losses in her career."}

{"ideal": "For people with type 1 diabetes much of their time is spent controlling the disease by testing their blood and injecting insulin.", "context": "For young people with diabetes it's particularly complicated, but even old hands sometimes just experience \"diabetes burnout\" where it all seems totally overwhelming.\nSo the idea of \"smart insulin\", a way to deliver this essential drug without all the testing and injections is hugely attractive and now scientists in Birmingham are starting work on a delivery system that might allow them do just that.\nIn a chemistry laboratory in the city I went to talk to Dr John Fossey. He's just secured funding from a USA diabetes charity for some exciting research into the \"smart insulin\" concept.\nDr Fossey and his team have used some very clever chemistry to create a gel that only dissolves in the presence of glucose. Indeed he showed me how his gel disappears in a glucose solution while just sitting there in ordinary water.\nThe idea is to load up the gel with insulin, then as the glucose levels rise in someone with diabetes, the gel dissolves and the insulin is released into their system.\nIt would be an alternative to the current methods where a diabetic has to carry out blood tests, work out the right dose of insulin and then inject it. With the gel, the chemistry does all this automatically.\nImagine you are a parent to a young child with type 1 diabetes and they want to go on a sleepover. Sadly the parent hosting the party is not comfortable overseeing the blood testing and insulin injections your child will need. Well with this gel you could inject your kid once, perhaps under the arm, and the gel would take care of everything. It might even be possible to reduce injections to just one a week.\nOther teams are trying something similar, but Dr Fossey believes his gel has unique chemistry that makes it the best prospect for this sort of approach.\nIt is very early stages in the research though. The USA diabetes charity funding lasts for two years. After they've worked out the chemistry, the project will then move into a biology lab and then eventually, in about 10 years, we might see clinical trials in humans.\nThat's assuming it all goes well.\nSo it is a long-term research project, but those involved in diabetes research say this is a really exciting potential new treatment.\nYou can read more about Dr Fossey's work here."}

Unlike League of Legends, it's based on Chinese historical characters. It's also specifically designed for play on a mobile platform.\nThis is a key reason it's so popular in China, where many gamers don't have access to a games console or PC at home.\nThe app is free to download, but players pay to upgrade their characters or costumes to help them advance to the next level.\nEstimates about how much an average player spends vary from about $1.50 to $6 a month.\nThat doesn't sound like much, but it all adds up in a game with more than 50 million monthly active users.\nParents and teachers worry that children are becoming addicted to the game.\nWhile hand-wringing over gaming is nothing new, Honour of Kings has drawn particular scorn from the government-owned People's Daily newspaper, which called it \"poison\" and a \"drug\" that harms teenagers.\nIt also called for tighter regulatory controls of online games.\nTencent's revenue model depends on getting existing gamers to spend more time on their products.\nIts last annual report says its strategy is to turn casual gamers into \"midcore\" or \"hardcore\" gamers.\nTencent made $7.2bn in the first quarter of this year, and more than half - about $3.9bn - came from gaming.\nTwo titles dominate its catalogue. League of Legends is its biggest title globally, but in China Honour of Kings is its highest grossing mobile game.\nChinese gaming industry database CNG estimates the game generated about $810.5m in the first quarter of this year. That would equate to about 11% of its total revenue.\nTencent is a huge company. Besides gaming it's in payment services, social media and messaging apps (notably the phenomenally successful WeChat).\nThe great majority of Tencent's business is in China, so it's vulnerable to regulatory changes there.\nThis could add to investor anxiety. After Tencent brought in the time limits, its shares fell 4%, wiping $12bn off its market value. But shares have rebounded slightly since then.\nAs a whole, the company has grown more than 40% over the past year, and it says the limits won't have much impact on the bottom line, because children under 12 are only a small part of its user base."}

They're from the war and crisis torn zones of North Africa and Asia - they're Libyans and Somalis, Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis.\nAsk yourself this, though. Where are they trying to come to Britain from? France, of course but, before they reached, Calais they had to come through other EU countries. If they came over the sea from Africa they probably came through Italy or Greece. If over land they may have come through Hungary which, believe it or not,  is currently taking in more asylum seekers than Italy.\nIn other words this crisis risks being seen as not an isolated issue about the Anglo-French border but as yet another another symptom of Europe's failing immigration system which, before the past few days, was highlighted by so many tragic deaths in the Mediterranean.\nThis flow of humanity which the authorities in so many countries illustrate the pull of Europe and Britain in particular for many whose lives are blighted by war and persecution or just - just? - by poverty, disease and hardship who can now see and hear about the prospect of a better life on their smartphones or on Facebook or Twitter.\nIt highlights the challenges posed by a wealthy bloc of countries whose immigration controls are only as strong as the weakest link in the borders of 28 nations and which allows people who make it through to pass their way across a continent with minimal or no checks at all.\nAll the polling evidence shows that what made immigration the issue people cared about most again and again in recent years was not opposition per se to allowing people to come to the UK. It was the widespread sense that the system was out of control and, therefore, unfair.\nListen to the voices of bewilderment and anger in Calais and Dover yesterday and you'll see that this story has the capacity to cut through in the way few have since the general election.\nThat is why the prime minister spoke today of \"totally unacceptable scenes\" which was his way of trying to say - \"I get it\"."}

His claim that refugees were systematically held in degrading conditions to deter others from seeking asylum is a stinging rebuke.\nCzech PM Bohuslav Sobotka defended his country, saying conditions in detention facilities were improving and that the criticism was  \"misplaced\". \"The Czech [Republic]has been striving - not just now but for some time - to respect international conventions,\" he added.\nMeanwhile the response from the president's office to Mr al-Hussein's criticism of President Zeman's 'Islamophobic' remarks was swift and uncompromising. \"This verbal attack on the president is not the first,\" his spokesman wrote on Facebook, claiming it was part of an \"intensifying\" campaign against the Czech Republic.\nMr Zeman recently warned Muslim migrants would not respect Czech customs and would bring with them Sharia law. \"The beauty of our women will be hidden, as they'll be forced to wear burkas,\" he recently said. \"Though I can think of some for whom this would be an improvement,\" he added.\nBoorish comments like this play well with a certain section of Czech society, which is - in general - hostile to the idea of accepting Muslim refugees. And Mr Zeman could well be standing for re-election in just over two years' time.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."}

But I haven't been able to play properly since Sunday. I feel tired and breathless in 20 minutes and then I just go back to my house.\nMy friends feel the same. We feel we have no stamina left.\nEarlier, we could play for hours without any problem. We are thinking that we should stop playing outdoors completely until the air becomes better.\nIt's so sad. Why do people set off fireworks? We don't need them. People need to know that our health is more important than fireworks. Please stop this madness.\nI have been an auto-rickshaw driver for more than 20 years but this is the first time I have seen such thick smog after Diwali. I am 55-years old and I cannot take such pollution at this age.\nThe government forced us to use compressed natural gas (CNG) for tuk-tuks to reduce pollution. I find it so ironic that we use greener fuel, but suffer the most due to pollution.\nTuk-tuks are open and that is why I have been literally breathing smog since Diwali. My eyes itch and I frequently feel breathless. But I can't rest because I have to earn every day for my family.\nI hope people stop setting off fireworks. It is a relatively new phenomenon, we only used to have lamps earlier. Diwali is about peace, not pollution.\nIt's sad when parents make WhatsApp groups to discuss which are the best face masks for children. We are talking about six year olds here.\nSchools are curtailing sports activities. Many friends are taking sudden vacations to get out of Delhi and escape the pollution. But not all of us can run away from here.\nSo to cope with the pollution, we wear masks when outside. Keeping our doors and windows shut and using multiple air purifiers at home helps to a certain degree.\nEven with all these precautions, many children, specially those facing breathing problems or persistent coughs, need daily nebulisation.\nI haven't been able to send my two sons out to play since Diwali.\nShilpa Kannan is a BBC journalist\nI am a businessman and I have to meet several people every day. But I have consciously tried to not go out much because of the smog since Diwali.\nI feel breathless even inside my car. I can't keep the windows of my house open. Delhi has become a gas chamber and nobody seems to be doing anything to improve the situation.\nWe as a family don't set off fireworks and request other people to do the same, but then not many listen.\nI am thinking of buying air purifiers for my office and home, but that's not a permanent solution. People really have to understand that we have made the city a ticking time bomb.\nBut fireworks can't be blamed as the main contributor to pollution. Vehicle emission, dust coming from construction sites and smoke coming from burning of crop stubble in farms all contribute to Delhi pollution and the government needs to have a strict policy to deal with these issues."}

There were 461 cases in the first six months of this year.\nSymptoms include jaundice and sometimes tiredness, fever, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.\nMost people will get over the virus, although for some, such as those with an immune deficiency disorder, or pregnant women, it can prove fatal.\nProf Richard Tedder, at University College London (UCL), said HEV was \"very common\" in the UK - not all cases are noticed or recorded.\n\"This virus is taking off within the pig herds from which this country sources its processed pig meat in sausages and pork pies,\" he said.\nProf Tedder said sausages needed to be \"caramelised\" - cooked thoroughly - before eating to make sure they did not pose a health risk.\n\"It's a question of getting people to change,\" he said. \"Everybody knows you can get salmonella from chicken.\"\nHowever, he said, the figure of 1 in 10 sausages presenting a potential risk of hepatitis E infection if undercooked should be interpreted with caution.\n\"This figure was taken from a small survey (63 sausages), and is unlikely to be representative of the UK as a whole.\n\"Given what is known about the prevalence of high viraemia at the time of slaughter in the UK, a more representative figure would be about 1 in 100, or 1% of sausages, and any risk of infection can be alleviated by ensuring sausages are cooked thoroughly.\"\nHe said the virus occurred in the animal and in the blood system and warned it would continue unless there was a \"big change\" in animal practices, such as introducing different hygiene measures.\nDr Richard Bendall, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said HEV was the most common virus passed on through animals in Britain.\nHe said the virus was found in 10% of sausages and processed pork meat.\nThis estimate comes from a study that looked at the pork production chain in the UK.\nDr Harry Dalton, also at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said the virus was not just confined to pigs, people had caught it from strawberries irrigated with infected water.\nShellfish in west Scotland and Tuscany had also infected people, he said.\nIn Asia and Africa, hepatitis E is more commonly transmitted by contaminated drinking water."}

Mother and baby have to be separated.\"\nAt the moment Northern Ireland does not have an inpatient specialist mother and baby unit. In fact there is only one specialist psychiatrist for the entire region.\nTherefore when a woman is admitted to hospital for post-natal depression treatment they are separated from their baby.\nAccording to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, on average, 75 Northern Ireland mothers per year require admission to hospital.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Lynch said this was unfair.\n\"In Belfast, women have access to a limited service,\" she said.\n\"We could do a lot more if we'd more resources, and in all of the other trusts in Northern Ireland, women have no access to specialist dedicated help.\"\nIt is understood that the college has met at least five different health ministers over a period of 15 years, campaigning for a specialist mother and baby unit.

They argued that this was a later burial site, and not the original scene of his murder.\nThis \"burial theory\" may explain some perplexing facts about Oetzi.\nFor example, analysis suggests he died in the spring because the pollen of plants that bloom at that time of year is found in his gut. However, pollen within the ice suggests that the corpse was deposited in the late summer.\nProfessor Bondioli and his team say that these facts makes most sense if the body was deliberately carried to its site of discovery many months after death.\nThis suggests a burial.\nProfessor Bondioli elaborated: \"Oetzi must have been a very important person to be taken to this high mountain pass for burial. Perhaps he was some sort of a chieftain.\"\nNot bullet proof\nHowever, Professor Frank Ruehli of the University of Zurich, the medical doctor who performed the original autopsy, is not totally convinced by the burial theory.\nHe remarked: \"The left arm of the corpse is in a weird position. This must have happened at the time of death.\"\n\"If Oetzi was a chieftain, why did his people not move the twisted arm into a more natural position?\" he told BBC News. \"This would be expected in the burial of an important person\".\nAlso somewhat sceptical is Dr Wolfgang Muller of Royal Holloway University of London. He studied the chemistry of Oetzi's teeth and bones to track his migration route through the Alps.\n\"It's an interesting new interpretation but it's not bullet proof,\" he said. \"However, if Oetzi was buried they must have carried the body a long way because the nearby villages would have been at a low altitude.\"\nWhile much remains to be learned about the enigmatic Iceman - as the mummified corpse has been dubbed - one thing is certain: This famous mummy will remain the subject of intense speculation and new research for decades to come."}

The pavements around Parliament heave with visitors snapping pictures of the mighty clock. From Seoul to Spain it's seen as the symbol of British government. Stable, solid, timeless.\nAs Orwell described England in 1941.... \"it is continuous, it stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as in a living creature.\"\nBut nothing is the same.\nWestminster's politicians are dazed and disorientated. They feel politics as they know it is cracking up. The main parties are scrambling to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom.\nThe sleepy assumption that separation would never happen has vanished.  If it happens, Westminster will soon lose its 59 Scottish MPs.\nThe political damage to David Cameron and Ed Miliband would be immense.\nIf Scotland stays, a shift of new powers from London to Edinburgh is promised. The rest of Britain will be rewired too. It seems inevitable there will be a devolution of power within England. The remaining Scottish MPs in Westminster would surely lose their right to vote on English matters. The so-called West Lothian Question would need to be answered. The constitutional obsessions of political scientists are no longer niche. They're pressing and urgent.\nThe crack up has been brewing for several years. Not just the decades' long gestation of Scottish separatism. But in the fading confidence of Westminster's politicians.\nThe expenses scandal of 2009 was memorable not just for the ludicrous receipt-free claims and care-free sense of entitlement to public money. It was memorable too for the raw fury it unleashed among voters.\nThe public's trust in politicians had been falling for years. For many voters the scandal exposed a vacuity at the heart of British politics and sealed their contempt for politicians.\nWhen UKIP's leader Nigel Farage condemns the Westminster political establishment he echoes a recruiting message of the Yes campaign in Scotland.\nThere are big differences between the SNP, the Yes movement and UKIP. But both parties are nationalist and both promise a rejection of politics as usual. They're tapping a deep disillusionment with Westminster politics. And they're both posing an electoral nightmare for the three main parties whose memberships have been in sharp decline for years. Together they have fewer members than the RSPB.\nAs Labour is discovering in Scotland - it isn't possible to mobilise huge blocks of supporters if the party members and foot-soldiers aren't there anymore.\nIt's not an original observation that Westminster politics has a so-called \"professional political class\" at its heart - people who were familiar with the ways of Westminster long before they were elected. Voters have sussed this out. Not dogmatic or interested enough to join a political party themselves they find the entrances to politics blocked.\nShrinking political parties remain the gateways to council seats and the green benches. Politicians claim the media plays its part in sowing disillusionment with the difficult business of doing politics.\nThe referendum has electrified politics in Scotland and prompted profound questions in Westminster.\nIs the rise of English nationalism now inevitable or will greater regional devolution extinguish the UKIP surge?\nAre we seeing a nationalist reaction to the forces of globalisation? Can political parties as we've known them survive?\nHow should we be governed and where should power lie? While the main parties panic about Scotland they're also looking anxiously at the future. Everything looks the same but Westminster politics will never be the same again."}

She helped set up an art therapy space in a community centre close to the Grenfell Tower in the days after the blaze.\nShe said: \"The children just have some art materials and they're free to do whatever they want to.\n\"That's been enormously helpful in this crisis and trauma whereby the children are just allowed a space to process their feelings through the art when words really aren't enough or even possible quite a lot of the time.\"\nShe added: \"The tower features in a lot of their drawings because it's there, it's everybody's eye shot. It's in everything, it's everywhere we look, it's everywhere we go.\n\"But also there's a lot of other stuff, there's indescribable things, a lot of mess-making, a lot of stuff that's just processing which isn't pretty pictures or even horrible pictures, it's just something in the art materials themselves that really make it possible for the children to process some of their feelings in a very visceral way.\"\nBack in Edinburgh, nine-year-old Wahaj, has been making a clay mask. He wants to give it to his cousin as a thank you present for fixing one of his games.\n\"I think it's better because if you sit there forever, it makes you feel bored,\" he said. \"But over here when you're doing stuff, making stuff like masks is more fun.\"\nArt therapist Eilidh Gilbertson said they have good results from their work.\n\"If something terrible's happened they can make an image that responds to that where they don't have the words to communicate.\n\"This calms them down, they get to work with other children, they get to work with materials, it can relax them and calm them down a little bit.\""}

And many in the MBCT group had been tapered off their medication.\nScientists say these findings suggest MBCT could provide a much-needed alternative for people who cannot or do not wish to take long-term drugs.\nIn their report, they conclude it \"may be a new choice for millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions.\"\nNigel Reed, who took part in the study, added: \"Mindfulness gives me a set of skills which I use to keep well in the long term.\n\"Rather than relying on the continuing use of anti-depressants, mindfulness puts me in charge, allowing me to take control of my own future, to spot when I am at risk and to make the changes I need to stay well.\"\nProviding an independent comment on the study, Dr Gwen Adshead, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \"These findings are important from the point of view of people living with depression who are trying to engage in their own recovery.\n\"And it provides evidence that MBCT is an intervention that primary care physicians should take seriously as an option.\"\nBut he cautioned the research does not suggest MBCT is useful for all types of depression; nor that it should replace anti-depressant treatment for people with severe disorders who have needed hospital treatment or are suicidal.\nAnd experts caution patients should only reduce their anti-depressant medication under medical supervision.\nProf Eduard Vieta, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Barcelona, Spain, said there needed to be more studies to establish how effective MBCT might be.\nResearchers say their next step is to tease out what the active ingredient in mindfulness therapy might be, and to check it compares favourably to other group-based approaches."}

The assembly might end up choosing a successor to Ayatollah Khamenei, who is 76 and has suffered ill-health.\nWhat is the Assembly of Experts?\nIran elections: Five things to know\nElections highlight divisions\nPunchy politics on social media\nEarly results gave Mr Rafsanjani, a moderate Conservative, and Mr Rouhani respectively the most votes for the assembly, which is composed of mostly elder and senior clerics.\nBy contrast, the leading candidate of Islamic hardliners, Ayatollah Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, was hovering near the bottom of the list.\nFor parliament, former Vice-President Mohammad Reza Araf was topping the list for the capital with almost half the votes counted there. The only conservative so far was former parliament speaker Gholamali Haddad-Adel, in seventh place.\nThe result is significant because lawmakers from the capital usually determine the political direction of the house, analysts say.\nHowever they add that the picture may be more mixed in smaller towns across the country.\nMr Rouhani said the election gave the government more credibility and clout.\n\"The competition is over. It's time to open a new chapter in Iran's economic development based on domestic abilities and international opportunities,\" the official Irna news agency quoted him as saying.\n\"The people showed their power once again and gave more credibility and strength to their elected government.\"\nVoting was extended three times on Friday as crowds reportedly flocked to polling stations. Turnout was more than 60%.\nReformists, who want better relations with the outside world and more freedoms at home, are hoping to gain influence in the conservative-dominated bodies.\nBut of 12,000 people who registered as candidates, only half were allowed to stand, including just 200 moderates.\nThe results of the parliamentary election could take longer to emerge than for the Assembly of Experts and the parliamentary vote is likely to go to a second round in April.\nCandidates need 25% of the vote to win outright and there is an average of 17 candidates per seat. Elected MPs will serve four-year terms.\nThis was the first election to be held since last year's deal between Iran and world powers over the country's nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions.\nBBC Persian's Ali Hamedani says the economy was a key issue in the process.\nWith sanctions lifted and Western investors beginning to return to Iran, there are high hopes for an improvement in daily life, he says.\nReformists and moderates say they are targeting greater foreign investment which, our correspondent says, will create jobs for young people.\nMore than half of Iranians are under 35 but the youth unemployment rate is 25% - more than two and a half times the national average.\nHowever, conservatives say strong economic growth is more likely to come from domestic production in what they describe as a \"resistance economy\" that draws on the ideals of the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution."}

But the researchers say that it was not sufficiently severe that any of the animals required treatment.\nAre cloned animals born old?\nWhen she was born on 5 July 1996, Dolly was the first animal to be cloned from an adult cell using a technique known as somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).\nWriting in Nature Communications, a team led by Prof Kevin Sinclair at Nottingham University reports that the sheep Debbie, Denise, Dianna and Daisy reached their eighth birthdays in good health.\nThe Nottingham team based their conclusions on examination of Dolly's four \"sisters\" and nine other cloned sheep - all between seven and nine years of age.\n\"Healthy ageing of SCNT clones has never been properly investigated,\" said Prof Sinclair.\n\"Following our detailed assessments of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure and musculoskeletal investigations we found that our clones, considering their age, were at the time of our research healthy.\"\nThe researchers performed  a battery of tests, including assessments of the animals' bones, joints and muscles, along with blood pressure measurements. They then compared these to \"control\" sheep aged between five and six years old.\nThey found no major health issues: there was no sign of metabolic disease, such as diabetes, in the clones and their blood pressure was normal.\nThe evidence of mild osteoarthritis in the clones - and a moderate case of the disease in Debbie - could be a normal feature of sheep as they age, the researchers write in their scientific paper.\nDolly's birth was a sensation when first announced to the world, and the technique that produced her was heralded as a way to develop new medical therapies or to save endangered species. But cloning is very inefficient. And even after 20 years of additional investigation, too many experiments yield no viable clone.\nProf Sinclair said the latest study offered a route to better understand why this was so, but conceded that SCNT still had a way to go to fulfil its promise.\nHe told BBC News: \"And so there still remains an ethical and welfare concern with cloning and what we have to do is reduce the incidence of these losses to levels that approach those of natural conception before I think the technique would be widely accepted by the general public.\"\nWhen the Nottingham study was conducted last year, Dolly's sisters were aged eight. They have recently turned nine, which roughly corresponds to an age of 60-70 in human years.\nThe scientists will further assess the osteoarthritis question when the sheep die and post-mortem examinations can be carried out.\nThe effort to clone Dolly was led at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh by Prof Sir Ian Wilmut, who later abandoned research on SCNT.\nThe late Prof Keith Campbell was instrumental in this pioneering work. In 1999, he joined the University of Nottingham where he continued his research in reproductive biology until his death in 2012.\nThe flock of cloned sheep is his legacy to the university."}

Kate Bush, barefoot and in black, sang into a microphone with a seven-piece band behind her. After her second song, Hounds of Love, she declared \"I need a drink of water\" and swigged from a bottle at the side of the stage.\nThis could have been any gig almost anywhere. Perhaps Bush had decided to abandon the lavish theatricals of her one and only tour 35 years earlier in favour of something more conventional.\nBut then, six songs in, everything changed.\nA dancer leapt centre stage, manically spinning an object around his head. Confetti exploded into the auditorium, and a giant screen dropped in front of the stage and played a short film featuring an astronomer.\nHere, at last, was the much-anticipated live performance of The Ninth Wave, Kate Bush's 30-minute sonic odyssey about a shipwreck from 1985's Hounds of Love album.\nWhat followed were surely some of the most mind-bending images ever to find their way into a rock concert - huge billowing sheets making a seascape, a search-and-rescue helicopter buzzing over the audience and sailors in lifejackets brandishing hatchets and a chainsaw.\nThere was even a bizarre mini-play - with Bush's teenage son Bertie as one of the characters - about cooking sausages.\nAnd in the midst of it all Bush herself was carried off by what can only be described as fish skeleton creatures. This was the stuff of nightmares.\nEven lovers of Kate Bush's music - and the Hammersmith Apollo was packed with them - were not expecting something so off the chart.\nIt felt like an opera, am-dram, a movie and a West End musical rolled into one.\nAfter a 20-minute interval, Bush was back with more stunning visuals to accompany a batch of songs - collectively known as The Sky of Honey - from the 2005 album Aerial.\nA wooden puppet child wandered the stage as Bush sang at her piano. Giant projections of birds in flight filled the back of the stage while 16-year-old Bertie was back in the role of an artist at work on a huge canvas.  He even got to sing a solo song, Tawny Moon.\nThe early songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s that made a Bush a household name were absent, but no-one seemed to mind.\nBush may not be the energetic 20-year-old who last performed on the same stage in 1979, but the 56-year-old singer has retained the power to entrance her audience. Among the cheers, some were moved to tears at this most unpredictable of comebacks.\nAfter the three-hour show, thousands spilled out into a damp London night knowing they had witnessed something unique. It's likely that many will wake next morning feeling they have been not only to a gig, but squeezed in a trip to the cinema and the theatre as well."}

It's not about runs all the time, but about the way he played him. He was comfortable. The other batsmen were like a cat on a hot tin roof. They were fidgety all the time.\n\"He wasn't hurried and wasn't frightened of the leg-spinner.

I probably haven't shown people what I can do on this arena so far. It's nice to have a really good Test match. It's just my day that I managed to get the wickets.\n\"The guys have already stuck the tape on the Lord's honours board for it to be engraved [for taking 10 wickets in a Test]. There are some amazing names on that board - the legends of the game.\n\"The 10th was in the back of my mind particularly when I got my third wicket in this innings. To get that 10th and get on the board, it was a lovely moment. When you take that 10th, it is hard to explain, but I suppose the celebrations tell a story as well.\"\nMike Ball: Woakes is going to be a more important all-rounder to England than Stokes, but what a team we'll have with them both playing.\nDavid Beckett: Woakes is exceptional. Stokes and Anderson should come in for Finn and Ball. Maybe even Rashid for Moeen.\nThomas Measures: Starting to worry less about Anderson retiring with every games Woakes plays.

Quickly.\n\"This was one of the greatest goalscorers we have seen having an absolute nightmare,\" said former England captain Alan Shearer.\nRonaldo, 31, looked happy and relaxed as the match got under way. About 20,000 fans from his homeland were banking on him to score and help Portugal towards a place in the last 16.\nHe looked certain to do just that with a close-range sidefooted effort in the first half but staggeringly steered the ball wide. It was the first of 10 efforts in the game - all unsuccessful.\nThe Real Madrid forward spent the rest of the first half drifting across Portugal's front line, looking for support from former Manchester United colleague Nani, but struggled to make a real impact.\nBy the time Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli blew for half-time, Ronaldo looked so deflated it took him a good minute longer than any other player to trudge off down the tunnel.\nMaybe the second half would bring Ronaldo better luck? Maybe not.\nThere were a couple of mishit free-kicks (taking his tally to 36 direct free-kicks attempted at major tournaments, no goals), the occasional flick and feint, and time and again he implored team-mates to spread the ball wide and send it into the penalty box for him to utilise his heading prowess.\nJust when it seemed the script appeared to have taken a twist in his favour as Martin Hinteregger wrestled him to the ground for a penalty, the worst was to come.\nThe man who sealed the shootout win for Real Madrid against against city rivals Atletico in the Champions League final a few weeks ago could not deliver from the penalty spot.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThere were gasps of disbelief from 20,000 Portuguese fans, who had never before seen one of their players miss a spot-kick outside of a shootout at a major tournament. There were almost as many howls of delight from Austria's fans as he sent his effort against the post. It was his fourth missed penalty in his past five attempts for club and country.\n\"He created a lot of chances and normally he would have scored a hat-trick,\" said Match of the Day pundit Thierry Henry. \"When he was about to take the penalty I didn't fancy him - sometimes you can see when a player is not at it and he wasn't tonight.\"\nEven then, there was another cruel twist when he finally found the net with a superb glancing header but was thwarted by the offside flag - cue more histrionics.\nThat effort took his tally of shots in the tournament to 20 - 11 more than any other player and more than nine other teams.\n\"We did everything right but the ball did not go in, once again,\" said another former Manchester United winger, Nani.\n\"What can we say? We cannot excuse ourselves with 'the ball won't go in' - we had chances.\"\nThe only victory of sorts came at the very end, when the match had finished. A fan sprinted on to the pitch and Ronaldo seemed more than happy to pose for a selfie.\nThe stewards had tried to stop the invader and Ronaldo was arguably reckless and irresponsible - or very accommodating - despite his miserable evening.\n\"His performance showed he's human,\" said Ronaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand on Match of the Day.\n\"What he's been doing for 10 years has been relentless - achievement after achievement. He didn't get the rub of the green but he kept going and his head didn't drop.\"\nThe Ronaldo roadshow will roll on to a game against Hungary in Lyon on Wednesday, with Portugal's captain desperate to ensure he is not remembered for failing on the biggest of stages."}

Also, their brains are longer top-to-bottom than front-to-back, meaning the force against the skull is spread over a larger brain area.\nA highly-developed bone called the hyoid - which in humans is just above the \"Adam's apple\" - has also been studied: starting at the underside of the birds' beaks, it makes a full loop through their nostrils, under and around the back of their skulls, over the top and meeting again before the forehead.\nHowever, Ming Zhang of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a co-author of the new work, said that he and his colleagues wanted to get to the bottom of the problem numerically.\n\"We thought that most of the previous studies were limited to the qualitative answer to this question,\" he told BBC News.\n\"More quantitative studies are necessary to answer this interesting problem, which would aid in applying the bio-mechanism to human protective device design and even to some industry design.\"\nFirst, the team had a look at woodpeckers in a controlled environment: two slow-motion cameras captured images of the birds striking a force sensor that measured their pecking power.\nThey found that the birds slightly turn their heads as they peck, which influences how forces are transmitted.\nThe team also gathered computed tomography and scanning electron microscope analyses of woodpecker skulls, laying out in detail how the parts fit together and where bone density varied.\nWith those data in hand, they were able to use a computer simulation to calculate the forces throughout the birds' skulls in the process of pecking.\nThe team's simulations showed that three factors were at work in sparing the birds injury.\nFirstly, the hyoid bone's looping structure around the whole skull was found to act as a \"safety belt\", especially after the initial impact.\nThe team also found that the upper and lower halves of the birds' beaks were uneven, and as force was transmitted from the tip of the beak into the bone, this asymmetry lowered the load that made it as far as the brain.\nLastly, plate-like bones with a \"spongy\" structure at different points in the skull helped distribute the incoming force, thereby protecting the brain.\nThe team stresses that it is the combination of the three, rather than any one feature, that keeps woodpeckers pecking without injury."}

Despite the connection, the spokesman said Lizard Squad did not play a \"large part\" in the attacks the GoP mounted against Sony.\nGoP's attacks involved exposing confidential information about many Sony employees and sharing thousands of emails sent between employees, film stars and movie makers.\nThe Lizard Squad member said his group \"handed over some Sony employee logins\" that were used by GoP to get its initial attack underway. The admission is the first acknowledgement by the Lizard Squad of its connection to GoP.\nThe information throws some doubt on the theory that North Korea was behind the attacks on Sony's internal systems. The state was accused of being behind the hack by the FBI because The Interview is about a fictional American plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and Pyongyang has filed formal complaints about the film.\nHowever, the Reuters news agency has reported that US investigators are exploring whether North Korea \"contracted out\" some of the work involved, which could explain how Lizard Squad formed links to GoP.\nLizard Squad members are all based in European nations, said the senior member.\nThe GoP attacks forced Sony to withdraw the film from its planned release, but it is now available to view online and is on show at some cinemas. It made about $15m (Â£9.6m) through downloads alone over its first three days of distribution.\nThe Lizard Squad spokesperson did not elaborate on how the group got hold of the login information for Sony employees. However, it is possible it found or uncovered them while searching for ways to attack the PlayStation gaming network.\nThe Lizard Squad has repeatedly attacked Sony's network and many others during 2014. On Christmas Day it managed to disrupt it and the Xbox Live network for hours leaving many gamers unable to log in.\nThe spokesperson said the attacks were carried out to expose the \"massive security issues\" many large companies suffer.\n\"The customers of these companies should be rather worried,\" they said.\nThe attacks on the PlayStation and Xbox networks have now stopped thanks to the intervention of tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. Instead, the group has switched its attention to the Tor network which has taken steps to limit the effect the Lizard Squad can have on the system."}

The researchers then used a computer algorithm that scored words according to how closely they are related in terms of meaning.\nThe results were converted into a thesaurus-like map where the words were arranged on the left and right hemispheres of the brain.\nThey show that the semantic system is distributed broadly in more than 100 distinct areas across both halves - hemispheres - of the cortex and in intricate patterns that were consistent across individuals in the study.\nThe maps show that many areas of the human brain represent language describing people and social relations rather than abstract concepts.\nBut the same word could be repeated several times on different parts of the brain map. For example, the word \"top\" was represented in a part of the brain that responds to words about clothing and appearance, and also in a region that deals with numbers and measurements.\n\"Our semantic models are good at predicting responses to language in several big swaths of cortex,\" said Dr Huth.\n\"But we also get the fine-grained information that tells us what kind of information is represented in each brain area. That's why these maps are so exciting and hold so much potential.\"\nScientists could track the brain activity of patients who have difficulty communicating and then match that data to language maps to determine what their patients are trying to express.\n\"Although the maps are broadly consistent across individuals, there are also substantial individual differences,\" said the study's senior author Jack Gallant.\n\"We will need to conduct further studies across a larger, more diverse sample of people before we will be able to map these individual differences in detail.\""}

The system was based on number plates so a licence ending in a five or six meant the car couldn't be driven on Monday and so on.\nThe programme, known as Hoy No Circula, has been hugely successful in terms of compliance and has seen some improvements in air quality with Mexico no longer ranked as the most polluted city, having been overtaken on that dubious honour list by the likes of Beijing and Delhi.\nMexico's driving curbs were extended to Saturdays back in 2008 with an analysis carried out beforehand indicating that nitrogen oxides and large particulates would decline by 16%.\nTo look at the impact of the Saturday restriction, US researchers analysed not just air quality samples but also public transportation numbers and weekend attendance at the city's zoo to get a clearer picture of overall activity.\n\"I looked at a whole bunch of pollutants, mean levels, maximum levels, every hour of the day, but I couldn't find any evidence that the programme improved air quality,\" Dr Lucas Davis from the University of California, Berkeley, who carried out the study told BBC News.\n\"The thinking was it was supposed to get people to take public transportation but if you look at data, they didn't and anecdotally people say they don't take the subway on the day they can't drive, they get a family member to drive them or they take taxis.\"\nPublic transport in Mexico City is inexpensive the author says, but often overcrowded. He also believes there are cultural factors behind the reluctance to give up the car.\n\"Driving is a real status symbol in Mexico City, and once a family have raised enough money to buy a car, there's a status associated with private vehicles that's tough for people to break. There's a bit of a cultural or socio-economic resistance to taking public transport.\"\nDespite this study, other experts believe that Mexico has made significant strides towards improving the environment while both the population and the economy have expanded and hundreds of thousands of new vehicles have come on to the roads.\n\"Alongside driving restrictions, Mexico City has made massive investments in public transport to provide cleaner alternatives to driving,\" said Mark Watts, executive director of C40, the global network of cities dedicated to improving the environment and fighting climate change.\n\"Several new bus rapid transit lines have opened recently and they have the largest year-round bike sharing scheme in North America. At the recent C40 Mayors Summit hosted by Mexico City, Mayor Mancera committed to ban diesel cars from the city by 2025, because they are responsible for the pollutants that are most dangerous to public health.\"\nMadrid, Athens and Paris have have also promised to stop the use of all diesel powered cars and trucks from the middle of the next decade.\nMany cities in emerging economies are now putting driving restrictions similar to Mexico in place to curb the growing problem of dirty air.  So are there lessons in the Mexican experience that will make the imposition of driving schemes more effective in other growing cities?\n\"You have to go more directly after pollution,\" says Dr Davis.\n\"So that means increasing the cost of driving, and that means higher gas prices, or congestion pricing or parking and it also means more emissions testing and making it more stringent.\"\nThe research has been published in the journal, Scientific Reports.\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook"}

{"ideal": "In Prime Minister's Questions this week, Jeremy Corbyn said a million people had accessed a food bank last year, compared with 40,000 in 2010.", "context": "The claim: A million people used food banks last year - up from 40,000 in 2010.\nReality Check verdict: More than a million food packages were handed out last year by the Trussell Trust, to a little over half a million people. This is significantly higher than in 2010. We don't know how much of this increase is down to an increase in demand and how much is because of new food banks opening in areas where people were already in need.\nBut that's not quite right. There were more than a million emergency food packages handed out in the last financial year. However, as we've pointed out before, this doesn't mean a million people accessed a food bank.\nThe main provider of food banks across the UK, the Trussell Trust, said it handed out 1.1 million emergency three-day food supplies in 2015-16, 2% more than in the previous financial year.\nThe network of food banks counts the number of vouchers it collects and one person can receive more than one voucher in the course of a year.\nThe charity says the average person using its food banks needs two vouchers a year. Based on this, we can estimate that there were a little over half a million unique users last year.\nFor comparison, 40,898 food packages were handed out in the financial year 2009-10, which seems to be the 40,000 figure to which Mr Corbyn refers.\nIn his question, Mr Corbyn also said: \"This week, an Oxford University study found that there is a direct link between rising levels of benefit sanctions and rising demand for food banks.\"\nThe report found the Trussell Trust's network of food banks experienced a spike in numbers after 2013, when more than one million sanctions were applied following changes to the administration of Jobseeker's Allowance. Between the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15, foodbank use rose by 19%.\nResearchers found that, on average, for every 10 additional sanctions applied in each quarter of the year, five more adults would be referred to food banks in the area. As sanctioning decreased, food bank use also decreased.\nThere are no official government figures on food bank use. In 2013 the then Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, David Heath, said: \"The government does not believe it is possible to keep a record of the number of food banks, nor the potential number of people using them or other types of food aid, without placing unnecessary burdens on volunteers trying to help their communities.\"\nWhile the Trussell Trust runs the country's largest network of food banks and is our best source of data, more people may access food donations on an informal level through other charities, churches and drop-in centres.\nThis means we can't be sure exactly how many people rely on food aid.\nThere has also been a sharp rise in the number of food banks operating since 2010, so we can't necessarily tell whether all of the rise in food bank use is down to growing demand - some of it might be existing demand that previously went unmet.\nTrussell Trust data shows the most common reason for people having to access food banks was benefits delays (which includes sanctions) in 28% of cases, followed by low income (23%) and benefits changes (14%).\nWe know this because people using food banks run by the Trussell Trust have to be referred by a professional such as a doctor, social worker or Jobcentre worker, and these professionals have to tick a box stating the reason this service is needed.\nThe prevalence of people accessing food banks after benefit delays chimes with the University of Oxford's research.\nResearcher Dr Rachel Loopstra said: \"These findings show clear evidence of sanctions being linked to economic hardship and hunger.\"\nBecoming unemployed, homeless, sick or experiencing domestic abuse were other common reasons for people accessing food banks.

People still have a fairly strong desire to control their car, and producing these vehicles is more showcasing what's possible than what's likely at the moment.\"\nHe added that it was more likely the driver would be able to actively operate the vehicle in some places, but once he or she got into a controlled urban environment, the vehicle would take over.\n\"You'll arrive in a town - and there will be a signal sent to your car not to exceed a maximum speed, and you won't be able to, and distance to the car in front will also be controlled,\" he said.\n\"But it's still a long way off.\""}
{"ideal": "The departure of David Bernstein and Lord King from the Aston Villa board was triggered by a bitter fall-out with the club's owner Randy Lerner.", "context": "Bernstein and King wrote to Villa chairman Steve Hollis on Monday, tendering their resignations with immediate effect.\nIt can now be revealed that their decisions were the result of a highly unpleasant exchange with Lerner.\nAfter joining Villa in March and February respectively, Bernstein and King grew increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress they were able to make.\nThis came to a head when email communication between the pair, which included criticism of Lerner, was leaked to the US businessman.\nLerner responded with an email of his own that featured a stinging rebuke to Bernstein and King, which they felt left their positions untenable.\nThe incident was hinted at in King's resignation letter, which he started by telling Hollis: \"You will be aware of recent communications between the owner of Aston Villa and members of the Football Board.\n\"Following these, I am sure you will understand that it is with real sorrow that I am writing to tender my resignation as a director of Aston Villa Football Club Ltd with immediate effect.\n\"I do not take this course of action lightly. As a supporter for over 55 years, how could I?\"\nBernstein and King were stunned by the content and tone of Lerner's email - especially lifelong Villa fan King, given he has known the American since his takeover in 2006.\nDespite their dissatisfaction, it is likely Bernstein and King would have stayed at Villa until Lerner had fulfilled his aim of selling the club. But the hostile interaction created a rift that could not be repaired.\nKing, a former Governor of the Bank of England, added: \"It is no longer possible to carry out the role that I was asked to perform. When you [Hollis], David Bernstein and I were asked join the board, we were able to make a start. But progress has stalled.\"\nBernstein's resignation letter said: \"I was invited on to the board to oversee a much needed review of the football side of the club including all aspects of operations at Bodymoor Heath.\n\"Following this I was to lead the implementation of this review and the ongoing management of football at Aston Villa. To this end a football board was created consisting of four people with considerable football and relevant experience. For this new structure to work it required all at the club to accept new disciplines, clear reporting lines and to adhere to the authority delegated to the new football board.\n\"Unfortunately it has proved impossible to implement the agreed structure and my position has quickly become untenable. The issues at the club are fundamental and the solutions are radical and do not lend themselves to compromise.\"\nIt is understood that Bernstein and King came into Villa expecting a far greater level of authority and autonomy than they ultimately received.\nTheir initial communication with Lerner was positive, but that changed when they set about implementing their plans and it is not clear whether the owner was ever fully aware of the exact brief agreed between them and Hollis.\nThe newly formed football board - comprising Bernstein, King, former Villa player and manager Brian Little and ex-Football Association executive Adrian Bevington - never actually held a meeting or discussion as a group.\nLittle, who arrived on the same day as former FA and Manchester City chairman Bernstein, remains in his role as an advisor to the board.\nBevington is thought to be deliberating over whether to continue his work with the club, who were relegated from the Premier League with defeat at Manchester United last Saturday.\nBefore Bernstein and King left, they presented Hollis with a shortlist of candidates to succeed Remi Garde as manager following his sacking on 29 March.\nThat consisted of four names, as well as two back-up options.\nVilla say the managerial search \"remains a priority\", while Hollis is \"currently engaged in extensive negotiations in relation to the sale of the club\".\nHave you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

But he said the banks were partly to blame for their losses.\n\"AIB and BoS have undoubtedly acted carelessly and imprudently by failing to make full inquiries before advancing the money,\" he told the court during sentencing.\n\"Indeed the latter bank was given clear and precise warnings by its lawyers about the risks of accepting assurances in a letter from an alleged co-conspirator, a Swiss lawyer.\n\"It almost beggars belief senior management chose to disregard that warning and rushed to complete the deal at all costs.\n\"It is apparent from the evidence both the defendants took full advantage of the prevailing banking culture in which corners are cut, and checks on them superficial and cursory,\" Judge Goymer concluded.\nThe losses to the two banks were dwarfed by the initial sums of money involved in the frauds.\nClaiming to operate as the Pacific Group, the two men used bogus documents over a period of five years to dupe Allied Irish Banks (AIB) into lending them £740m to buy a portfolio of 16 different commercial properties.\nThe properties and their purchase were real, but their value was inflated, letting the fraudsters siphon off £60m for their own ends.\nThe bank only realised it had been defrauded when it learned that Kallakis had a previous conviction under a false name.\nIn a separate fraud, against the BoS, the two men persuaded it to agree a loan of 29m euros, supposedly to convert a former passenger ferry into a luxury super-yacht.\nAgain, forged documents were used and the boat in question, on which the loan was secured, was in fact leaking and contaminated with asbestos.\nBy the time this was discovered, only 5.7m euros of the loan had been handed over to the fraudsters."}

{"ideal": "In a football match, it is not usual to start 3-0 down.", "context": "But, in economic terms, that is effectively where the government is as it approaches the Autumn Statement at the end of the month.\nThe previous Chancellor, George Osborne, set the government three rules it would adhere to, an attempt to show a sceptical public that it was bearing down on the country's deficit (the amount a country spends on public services versus the amount a country earns via tax receipts) and being tough on the accumulation of debt (the overall amount a government owes).\nAll three have been broken or abandoned - the cap on welfare spending, the pledge to reduce debt as a proportion of national income and the promise to balance the books (so ending the deficit) by 2020.\nThe last target was dumped after the result of the referendum brought forward a raft of economic downgrades for the UK economy which - if they come to pass - will lead to a reduction in government income and make eliminating the deficit even more problematic without further tax rises and public sector cuts.\nThat is the unhelpfully cut-up pitch on which the present Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is playing ahead of his first major economic outing, the Autumn Statement in two weeks' time.\nToday's report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals the difficulties ahead.\nIt suggests that given the slowdown predicted in the economy the chancellor will be dealing with a public finances outlook £25bn worse than predicted in the Budget last March.\nWith no changes in policy - and that's a major assumption given that Mr Hammond is (a) a new chancellor and (b) has already spoken of a \"fiscal reset\" - the IFS says tax revenues will be £31bn lower.\nThat will be partially offset, the IFS says, by the £6bn the government may regain by ending its contributions to the EU budget.\nBut, again, that is a pretty major assumption.\nMany government sources I have spoken to believe that in order to smooth the transition to a free trade deal with the EU (particularly if there is no agreement on freedom of movement) the government may need to maintain some budget payments.\nOf course, in public finance terms, it is not all one-way traffic on Brexit.\nThe Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates to 0.25% reduces the cost of servicing the government's debt.\nThe fall in the value of the pound (which pushes up import prices) also makes Britain's trade deficit smaller as it improves export performance.\nAnd the increase in dollar earnings and profits for global companies based in the UK will also be beneficial for the government's tax receipts.\nThese are all rather more marginal than the overall negative effect of the predicted slowdown in the economy.\nSome believe those gloomy predictions will prove too pessimistic - just as the predictions of a possible recession this year proved to be.\nAnd, if they are, all the estimates on the public finances will have to be redone, again.\nSuch is the pain and unpredictability of economic forecasting.\nThis close to the Autumn Statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official economic watchdog - will be giving the Treasury weekly updates on its predictions for the future of the public finances.\nThe OBR is likely to downgrade its growth predictions for the UK economy - following in the footsteps of the Bank of England.\nThat means that government receipts will be forecast to be lower.\nThe government could respond by cutting spending further (unpalatable), raising taxes (unpalatable) or loosening the deficit reduction target (likely).\nIf economic growth does slow, Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre to gain back some of those lost goals will be limited."}

She says the crew was given permission by the jail authorities and the ministry of home affairs.\nActivist Kavita Krishnan wondered how Udwin was allowed access to convicts inside jail when authorities \"prevent most human rights campaigners in India from speaking to, let alone filming, prisoners\".\nThe hour-long film also includes extensive interviews of the victim's parents, families of the convicts and their lawyers, interspersed with reconstruction of the incident.\nMukesh Singh, who is facing the death penalty along with three others, expressed no remorse and blamed the victim for fighting back.\nTimes Now news channel promptly took the lead in whipping up a campaign against the film, which it has described as \"voyeuristic\" and against \"all norms of journalism\".\nSome media analysts believe this has more to do with the channel's rivalry with NDTV, which had the rights to broadcast the film.\nCritics of the film have variously accused it of glorifying the rapist by giving him a platform, encouraging copycat crimes, or prejudicing the appeals of the rapists and spurring demands to fast-track their executions.\nOthers have been outraged that Indian audiences have been \"exposed to the remarks of such a brutal man\" on prime-time news. Although, it has to be said, Indians are accustomed to some pretty shocking stuff on prime-time news.\nA Delhi court has blocked the film \"until further orders\" after police said Mukesh Singh's \"offensive and derogatory remarks\" were \"creating an atmosphere of fear and tension with the possibility of public outcry and law and order situation\".\nA cynical friend suggests most of this outcry and potential danger to the law and order situation is confined to the TV studios and social media.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh has promised an inquiry into how the prison authorities gave permission to the film-maker and said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the interview.\nSome say India has sadly become a country of bans - films, books, and in a recent case, even beef.\nIt is not clear though whether the film's ban was provoked by a touchy Indian government led by the image-conscious Prime Minister Narendra Modi or because the home ministry was embarrassed.\nMany believe that the ban on the film hurts India's reputation most.\nWhen Mr Modi is trying hard to spruce up India's global image as a favoured destination to invest and visit, such ham-fisted and impulsive reactions cannot really help.\n\"It is patronising to control what people see about their own country,\" an American artist said on my Twitter timeline.\n\"Nobody sensible is suggesting banning the film,\" says writer Salil Tripathi. \"That is wrong\".\nBut the more things change, the more they remain the same.\nSenior minister Venkaiah Naidu talks about a \"conspiracy to defame India\" and says the \"country will be harmed if Ms Udwin's documentary is broadcast outside India\".\nMany believe India's image will be harmed because India's government is not seen to be supportive of free speech, and not because of Mukesh Singh's odious remarks.\nWhy don't they let Indians watch the film and make up their minds about it? Why can't the state be less paternalistic?"}

He denies that charges against him, which he says are politically motivated.\nThe complete surprise of Mikheil Saakashvili's appointment as Odessa governor has left a large number of political observers at a loss for explanation.\nPresident Petro Poroshenko's reasons will be come clearer with time, but at the moment, many are struggling to see the strategy behind naming a former leader of another country to run a provincial government.\nSaakashvili is a political outsider, with few ties to the Odessa region, and comes with a reputation for divisiveness and a high level of self-involvement.\nBut he is a also pro-Western, pro-reform and apparently very loyal to Mr Poroshenko â€” which will come in handy if he takes on local corruption and vested interests, as Mr Poroshenko apparently wants.\nThe move could be a stroke of genius on Mr Poroshenko's part â€” or a blunder of breathtaking magnitude. At the very least, it points to his lack of choices among home-grown candidates.\nPresident Poroshenko made the announcement at a televised event in Odessa, with Mr Saakashvili standing beside him.\n\"We are united by our love of Odessa and Ukraine,\" Mr Poroshenko said, adding that that the new governor would bring in discipline and carry out much needed reforms.\n\"In just one year, Oddessites should feel that their living standards are higher.\"\nThe Ukrainian president also said his decision was part of his drive to limit the political influence of the country's oligarchs.\nAlthough there has been so far no official reaction from Russia, Moscow has been highly critical of him after Georgia and Russia fought a brief war in 2008.\nUnlike Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Odessa has not been hit by the fighting between government forces and pro-Russian rebels.\nHowever, tensions in the strategic port remain high after clashes between pro- and anti-government protesters on 2 May 2014 left more than 40 people dead.\nThe majority of those who died were pro-Russian activists who perished in a fire in a trade union building. Investigations into what caused the blaze are continuing.\nThe Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato all say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels in the east with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation.\nMoscow denies it, insisting that any Russians serving with the rebels are volunteers.\nMore than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine that began in April 2014 when rebels seized large parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

{"ideal": "It all started with an unexpected phone call last week.", "context": "Two officials were on the line from the US Embassy in London and from the White House.\nThey wanted to talk about the president's forthcoming visit, and they were dealing with countless options for media interviews.\nThey had decided there would be one broadcast interview during the visit, and they were \"wondering\" whether I'd be interested in taking it on.\nThey did not have to wonder for very long. A fraction of a second is all it took for me to summon my calmest voice and say \"certainly, of course, you bet, absolutely\" and any other number of ways of saying yes.\nInterviewing the most powerful man in the world is not an opportunity granted to many journalists.\nIt was already clear before he arrived in the UK that the president would have some controversial things to say about Britain's future in the EU.\nWhat no-one had expected was the force of that intervention and the bluntness of the language: \"back of the queue\" is not only un-American in style (as many have pointed out) but also notably stark in tone.\nThe president spent the morning at a so-called town hall event involving hundreds of young people at a venue in Westminster.\nHe is clearly at home with this format: he was relaxed, humorous (in a cool, self-deprecating way), informed, engaging, and happy to admit that he didn't have answers to some of the questions.\nI watched some of the exchanges and then left to prepare for the interview in an adjoining room.\nThe crew had set up cameras, lights and sound the previous day and were ready to go. All we needed was the president.\nAnyone who reckons that interviewing a serving US president is a breeze needs to pause and think.\nThe potential global audience is huge, the matters to be discussed are extremely important, and there is no room for error. There is no hiding place.\nThe stakes for the president are always sky-high, in everything he does, but it is also true that the stakes for a journalist in this position are not insignificant.\nWe were given a one-minute warning for the president's arrival. Suddenly the door opened and there he was, smiling broadly, shaking hands firmly, greeting everyone warmly.\nI had been given plenty of advice about reading the presidential body language during the interview.\nThe challenge for the interviewer is clear: to ask as many searching questions as possible within the allocated time. That time can be fixed or less fixed. It often depends on how the interview is progressing.\nThe president fielded the questions with his brand of polite firmness, even when repeatedly challenged about the meaning of \"back of the queue\", the offence and anxiety this had caused in some quarters, and the potential impact on the wider special relationship (intelligence-sharing, for example) of a British departure from the EU.\nAt another point he rejected suggestions that Europe's migration crisis has been caused in part by America's reluctance to take assertive action in Syria.\nHe did allow himself a smile when talking about his wife's importance to his presidency (\"I am labour, she's management\"), and about the experience of being driven around Windsor by the 94 year-old Duke of Edinburgh (a \"smooth ride\").\nBut this was above all a serious exchange about some of the biggest challenges of the day.\nHe thanked every member of the broadcast team before leaving the room, and chatted with a few of us about his love of Shakespeare (his favourites are Hamlet and Lear). He then left for a meeting with Labour's Jeremy Corbyn.\nAnd a final thought: a president in his final year who can still enthuse a big crowd of young people - of all backgrounds - is an exceptional politician.\nWhatever your views on his politics, that judgement is very difficult to deny."}

But Pia Sundhage's side will rue their profligacy in front of goal, particularly in the first half.\nWambach was the biggest threat in that period and went closest when she crashed a vicious strike against the crossbar following a typical bulldozing run into the area.\nLively winger Lauren Cheney also went close on three occasions. First, she fired just wide at the near post before looping a header over. She then diverted Megan Rapinoe's delightful cross fractions off-target.\nAtlanta Beat midfielder Carli Lloyd also should have done better when she smashed her shot over the bar from 14 yards after Shannon Boxx's ball into the area was cleared into her path.\nJapan, who had not beaten the USA in 25 meetings - losing 22 of those, looked to catch their opponents on the counter. That tactic paid dividends against hosts Germany in the quarter-final and semi-final opponents Sweden, but the USA defence had dangerwomen Nahomi Kawasumi and Kozue Ando well-marshalled for much of the half.\nThe surprise finalists did manage to breach the USA area once in the opening half, when fleet-of-foot Shinobu Ohno, playing in her second World Cup, slid the ball into the path of Ando who fell over as she struck what was a tame effort into the hands of goalkeeper Hope Solo.\nThe second half followed a similar pattern to the first, with USA the more threatening of the two sides.\nForward Morgan, who came on at half-time for Cheney, tried to make her mark within four minutes of setting foot on the pitch, when she stretched out a leg to poke a driven cross against the post.\nThe pacy 22-year-old had given the USA an alternative target to the physical and aerial threat of Wambach, and in the 69th minute she scored what, at that point, was the most important goal of her young career.\nMidfielder Megan Rapinoe, whose delivery was exemplary on the night, launched a 50-yard pass over the top which Morgan latched onto before driving into the box and launching an angled drive past the reach of Ayumi Kaihori.\nThe youngster was close to tears as she slid to the ground and was embraced by her team-mates.\nThe USA seemed comfortably on course to victory with Japan dormant as an attacking force.\nBut with nine minutes remaining the Asian side woke up when Rachel Buehler and Alex Krieger failed to clear their lines allowing Miyama to smash the loose ball past Solo.\nThe USA were the stronger team in extra time and regained the lead at the end of the first period when Wambach headed in her 13th goal in world cup finals after connecting with Morgan's cross from the left.\nBut once again, resilient and stubborn Japan equalised when captain Sawa produced an audacious flick from a corner that left keeper Solo helpless.\nUSA pressed again in search for a late winner. Morgan was en route to scoring her second before she was brought down by Azuza Iwashimizu on the edge of the area, who received a straight red from referee Bibiana Steinhaus.\nThe free-kick came to nothing which was followed by the whistle to signal the end of extra-time.\nA nervous-looking Shannon Boxx set the tone for USA's penalty kicks as she struck her effort straight at Kaihori. The Japanese keeper also saved from Tobin Heath while Carli Lloyd blazed over the bar. Wambach was the only player to find the back of the net but by this stage it was advantage Japan.\nNorio Sasaki's side missed one but scored the all-important penalty when young defender Kumagai stayed cool to fire in a brilliant spot-kick high into net."}

Twelve were found guilty of murder and one of wounding with intent and possessing a bladed article.\nAmong them were Tyler Burton and Nicholas Terrelonge, who were found guilty of murdering Ashley Latty in a group attack in Dagenham, east London, in May 2014.\nRejecting their appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the Supreme Court judgement would \"not have made a difference\" to the jury's verdict in the trial and the convictions \"were and are safe\".\nAn appeal was also brought on behalf of Asher Johnson, his brother Lewis and Reece Garwood, who were given life sentences for the murder of Thomas Cudjoe in Ilford, east London, in November 2012.\nA fourth convicted man, Jerome Green, was seen in CCTV footage holding a knife and apparently stabbing Mr Cudjoe as he sat in the driver's seat of a car in a garage forecourt.\nLawyers argued there was no evidence of common enterprise between his clients and Green and the images did not show they had been involved in a planned attack.\nRejecting the appeal, Lord Thomas said the verdicts would have been \"no different\" following the Supreme Court ruling.\nHe said the court was \"satisfied that there was no injustice, let alone substantial injustice\".\nThe decision to reject their cases was met with cries of protest by supporters of the men sitting in the public gallery at the Court of Appeal.\nThe campaign group Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association (JENGBA) said families of those convicted under the law had been left in tears by the decision.\nGroup co-founder Jan Cunliffe said: \"Some of the families were very, very distraught and left the court room in tears.\n\"I'm feeling numb, but we're determined to carry on, we're not going to stop.\"\nShe said the group was taking advice about the possibility of challenging the judgement in the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruling applies to England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most UK overseas common law territories but not Scotland, which has its own rules on joint enterprise.\nAt the time, campaigners said the change would make the law fairer, but some murder victims' relatives said they were worried about possible appeals.\nJoint enterprise law was originally used to stop aristocrats from duelling, allowing all those involved in the duel, including doctors, to be charged with murder along with the duellists.\nThe law is regarded as a vital prosecuting tool and was used to convict David Norris and Gary Dobson in 2012 for the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence.\nHowever, in February the Supreme Court ruled that the courts \"took a wrong turn\" in 1984 in their interpretation of the law.\nThis judgement referred to a ruling in a case in which three gang members armed with knives burst into the home of a prostitute and her husband in Hong Kong, intending to collect a debt.\nThe husband was stabbed to death at the hand of at least one of the gang members and all three were convicted of murder.\nIn February judges said the error made had been \"to equate foresight with intent to assist, as a matter of law; the correct approach is to treat it as evidence of intent\"."}

As it pushes up against the air, the temperatures on its leading surfaces will soar to 1,700C.\nFlaps and thrusters will be used to control the trajectory, ensuring the IXV comes down close to a recovery ship some 3,000km west of the Galapagos Islands.\nA parachute system deployed in the very late stages of the flight will put the two-tonne vehicle gently in the water. Floatation balloons will come out to stop it from sinking.\nBeginning to end, the complete mission is expected to last approximately one hour and 40 minutes.\nEurope's expertise on re-entry technologies is more limited than, say, the US's or Russia's - something it wants to change with the help of the IXV.\nEsa's project manager Giorgio Tumino told BBC News: \"Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit.  So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations.\"\nEurope has produced one or two re-entry capsule systems in the past, but the IXV's complex \"lifting body\" is new territory.\nThe vehicle is packed with sensors. Their data will feed back into materials research and into the computer models used to describe the energetic physics that occurs when an object plunges through atmospheric gases at hypersonic speeds.\nThe IXV will start its data dump the moment it clears the descent's radio blackout phase, which occurs when the vehicle is enveloped by the hot plasma created during high-speed re-entry.\nGetting all the information off the craft while it is still in the air means the mission can complete its objectives even if something goes wrong at splashdown and the IXV sinks.\nEsa has already approved a follow-on project called Pride (Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe).\nThis would see the development of another re-entry vehicle but with a key difference - the ability to land on a runway.\nIn this respect, the Pride craft would look very similar to the X-37B mini shuttle, which is operated by the American military.\nNo-one is quite sure what missions are flown by this unmanned craft, but they are likely to include the early testing of new technologies for future satellites.\nThis could be a role also for Europe's Pride vehicle. In-orbit servicing of satellites is a capability often discussed in this context as well.\nEsa nations will meet shortly to define these roles.\n\"We need still to agree with all the member states all the different types of operations in orbit. But whatever the payload, it will always be in the perimeter space of civilian applications,\" stresses Mr Tumino.\nThe UK is not involved in the Italian-led IXV programme, but it is signed up to Pride, albeit at a low contribution.\nBritain's interests relate to reusable launcher technologies and to the safe return of planetary samples, such as rock specimens collected on Mars.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmosI"}
