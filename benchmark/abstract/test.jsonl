It has been the cornerstone of corporate governance ever since.\nIt recommended an independent board, reasonable pay to attract executives and formal processes to appoint directors.\n\"The Financial Reporting Council which controls the Cadbury code, and is a rather timid body, should get stronger,\" Lord Myners told the BBC's Today programme.\nIt should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change in a number of areas to strengthen governance\".\nThe code has no punitive means of enforcement and follows a so-called comply or explain model. If a company wishes to shun a particular rule, it can give its reasons for doing so.\nThis arrangement aims to stop companies ducking rules as a matter course and rewards openness. But critics say it treats all rules as optional.\n\"It hasn't been binding enough,\" Lord Myners said.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the FRC said: \"The FRC has called on the government for more powers to tackle all directors when companies fail, not just those we regulate (accountants and actuaries), and we want more scrutiny on directors fulfilling their obligations under the Companies Act.\n\"The Corporate Governance Code's 'comply or explain' approach has allowed the FRC to respond confidently and effectively to evolving market circumstances, which prescriptive hard rules often cannot.\"\nIts latest monitoring report on the code shows \"high compliance\" among companies, but when boards don't follow the rules \"too many explanations are of poor quality\".\n\"This suggests that some boards still need to do more than pay lip service to the needs of their shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\"The FRC believes more focused reporting by boards on how they discharge their responsibilities is necessary and has called for more oversight powers from government to help achieve this.\"\nAnother criticism from Lord Myners is the role of shareholders themselves in controlling corporations.\n\"Cadbury did not focus at all on the roles and the duties and obligation of the shareholders and that's where the failing is happening,\" he said.\n\"Nobody owns enough of a company to really be put out enough to really dig in and find out what's wrong.\" He termed this the problem of \"ownerless corporations.\"\nThis view echoed that of Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, who told the Today programme in September that UK companies should adopt a Swedish-style shareholder committee in an effort to curb excessive pay for bosses.\nThe five biggest shareholders in large publicly-traded companies would sit on the committee, Mr Philp suggested, and this would make decisions on pay and hiring directors.\nHis plan follows a call from Prime Minister Theresa May for tighter controls on corporate excess."}

He says the Northern Powerhouse gives his company \"real power, real punch\" on the world stage.\nBut Cheshire has been beaten in the race to take on devolved powers.\nOfficials have had to watch as devolution deals were done with the noisy neighbours in Manchester and Liverpool. They've even lost territory as the Cheshire borough of Halton decided to become part of the Liverpool city region.\nOver the summer, anxious to avoid being left behind, the two councils in the east and west of Cheshire, plus Warrington, hurriedly put together their own devolution bid to meet a tight government timetable.\nWarrington Borough Council's chief executive Steven Broomhead, who used to run the Northwest Regional Development Agency, said the bid wouldn't just \"enhance and grow\" the county's economy - it would allow the borough to escape the influence of its neighbours' elected mayors.\nBut as city regions have so far been the only places to have agreed deals, there's a lack of clarity over what a Cheshire deal might look like.\nIt seems so unclear that the leader of Warrington Borough Council, Terry O'Neill, recently said his authority wasn't sure whether devolution would be \"a poisoned chalice or an opportunity\".\nA report by the think tank IPPR North seems to acknowledge this, calling for \"greater clarification of the purpose, process and timescale\" of devolution deals for counties.\nIt's also not clear whether the government will insist on a Cheshire elected mayor.\nUntil there are firm answers to questions like those, the county's Powerhouse ambitions may just be held back."}

However, supporters argue the best rectors can be powerful ambassadors for their universities and champions of the students' interests.\nProf Sir Timothy said amendments to the bill could prove damaging to his university.\nHe said the amendments would allow for two elected positions playing a chairing role in the university - a rector and a senior lay member.\nThis would suggest changing what he described as the \"the long-established and well-understood role of our rector - without any prior consultation or discussion.\"\nHe also argued the senior lay member would appear to have significantly weaker powers than their counterparts at other universities - without any prior consultation.\nSir Timothy said: \"The amendments are inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging for one of Scotland's major universities.\n\"There has been no consultation or discussion with us, or the wider sector on the implications, which require careful consultation and scrutiny otherwise there is a real risk of perverse and possibly unintended consequences.\"\nHe argued it could even significantly impede the university's ability to contribute to the economic and social good of the country.\nHe urged Holyrood's education committee to ask the government to withdraw these amendments until they have consulted with those affected on the implications of their proposals.\nHowever, Sir Timothy also welcomed amendments to the bill, including one which removed some additional ministerial powers that he argued threatened the university's institutional autonomy.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"The Higher Education Governance Bill aims to ensure that the entire campus community has a say on how our higher education institutions are governed.\n\"We have worked closely with the sector over the course of the bill's development and will continue to listen to the views of all interested parties and consider all constructive suggestions as the bill continues to be considered by parliament.\n\"The detail of how a rector and new elected senior lay member would work together would remain, as now, a matter for each autonomous institution to address. The bill does not change that.\"\nThe Scottish government said any expansion in the role of the rector in a higher education institution beyond the current role set out in statute would be a matter for each institution.\n\"We think that the post of senior lay member should be an elected one,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"This role is pivotal in the leadership of all Scottish institutions, and all staff and students should have their say in appointing the best candidate for the role.\n\"The model for appointment of the senior lay member proposed by the Scottish Government has been discussed with stakeholders.\""}

She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis.  She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players.\nEach season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch.\nSome injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability.\nMost rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed.\nBut scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal.\nConcussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns.\nSome injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011.\nHe collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries.\nProf Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works.\n\"Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known,\" she said.\nShe added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries.\nThe RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested.\nAn RFU spokesman said: \"We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game.\n\"Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact.\n\"Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it.\n\"The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork.\""}

Inflation is at 180%, according to official figures, and there are shortages of medicines and basic food items.\nOn Friday, President Maduro declared a state of emergency to \"denounce, neutralise and overcome the external and foreign aggressions against our country\", which he blames for Venezuela's economic problems.\nIn measures published in the government gazette on Monday, the armed forces and local committees will now have powers to distribute and sell food.\nAuthorities will also be allowed to cut the working week in the private sector, as they have done in the public sector, to conserve electricity.\nThe new measures also allow the government to take control of basic goods or services, which analysts say opens the way to the expropriation of companies.\nOn 2 May, opposition politicians handed in 80 boxes containing 1.85 million signatures to the CNE, well above the 1% of voters on the electoral roll needed to kick-start the process.\nOpposition politicians say the authorities are trying to stall the process and have called on their supporters to march to the offices of the CNE on Wednesday to demand they verify the signatures so the process can go ahead.\nThe timing of a potential recall referendum is key because the outcome could be radically different depending on when it is held.\nUnder Venezuela's constitution, if President Maduro were to be removed by a recall referendum in his last two years in office, he would be replaced by his Vice-President, Mr Isturiz.\nBut if Mr Maduro were to be recalled before that, new elections would be triggered.\nThe opposition sees it as essential to have new elections rather than have Mr Isturiz take power, as he is seen as a loyal member of Mr Maduro's Socialist Unity Party.\nFor new elections to be held, the recall referendum would have to go against Mr Maduro before 10 January 2017."}

If it is negative it is contracting.\nAnd two consecutive three-month periods of contraction mean an economy is in recession.\nGDP can be measured in three ways:\nIn theory all three approaches should produce the same number.\nIn the UK the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP which, apart from the first estimate, is calculated using all three ways of measuring.\nUsually the main interest in the UK figures is in the quarterly change in GDP in real terms, that is after taking into account changes in prices (inflation).\nCalculating a GDP estimate for all three measures is a huge undertaking every three months.\nThe output measure alone - which is considered the most accurate in the short term - involves surveying tens of thousands of UK firms.\nThe main sources used for this are ONS surveys of manufacturing and service industries.\nInformation on sales is collected from 6,000 companies in manufacturing, 25,000 service sector firms, 5,000 retailers and 10,000 companies in the construction sector.\nData is also collected from government departments covering activities such as agriculture, energy, health and education.\nThe UK produces the earliest estimate of GDP of the major economies, around 25 days after the quarter in question.\nThis provides policymakers with an early, or \"flash\", estimate of the real growth in economic activity. It is quick, but only based on the output measure.\nAt that stage only about 40% of the data is available, so this figure is revised as more information comes in.\nThey are two subsequent revisions at monthly intervals. But this isn't the end.\nRevisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first \"flash\" estimate. The ONS publishes more information on how this is done  on its website.\nGDP is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy and is used by the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as one of the key indicators in setting interest rates.\nSo, for example, if prices are rising too fast, the Bank would be expected to increase interest rates to try to control them. But it may hold off if GDP growth is sluggish, as higher rates could damage the recovery. That is the situation at the moment.\nThe Treasury also uses GDP when planning economic policy. When an economy is contracting, tax receipts tend to fall, and the government adjusts its tax and spending plans accordingly.\nUK GDP is used internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the World Bank to compare the performance of different economies.\nThe European Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different countries' contributions to the EU budget.\nThe information in this article was provided by the Office for National Statistics."}

{"ideal": "So how has George Osborne pulled off the magical trick of maintaining spending on the police, imposing smaller than anticipated departmental spending cuts in general, and performing an expensive u-turn on tax-credit reductions, while remaining seemingly on course to turn this year's £74bn deficit into a £10bn surplus in 2020.", "context": "Well, it is because the government's forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has increased its prognosis of how much the Treasury will raise from existing taxes (not new ones) and reduced what it thinks the chancellor will shell out in interest on its massive debts.\nIn total the OBR thinks the national debt, the aggregate of the annual deficits, will be £23bn lower over the four years to 2020, and just because it is more optimistic about tax revenues and assorted costs.\nOr to put it another way, George Osborne is today £23bn better off than he thought in July, and without doing anything at all.\nWindfall\nSo what is the chancellor doing with this very useful £23bn that the OBR has found at the back of the sofa?\nWell he is using £19bn of it to cover the £4.4bn annual cost of not slashing tax credits, and making about £8bn a year less than expected in departmental savings.\nSo on paper it looks as though the chancellor is actually being a bit more prudent than he was in July, even though some would say he is expensively moving his party nearer to the centre-ground of British politics - which he thinks has been vacated by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour.\nTo labour the point, George Osborne is not deploying quite all of his windfall to buy off his critics by taking the teeth out of austerity.\nBut that does not mean there is no risk for him.\nThe OBR's fiscal optimism could well be misplaced - especially since only last week we saw government borrowing figures hideously worse than expected.\nBut presumably, if tax revenues turn out lower and interest payments higher than the chancellor is now banking on, he can attempt to blame and kick the forecasting agency, the OBR, which he created.\nAnd he'll hope, presumably, that voters won't see double standards in his years of bashing his Labour predecessors for spending tax revenues that never looked sustainable.\nGeorge Osborne has not quite morphed into his former opposite number, Ed Balls. But he is, in a more Ballsian way, counting on economic recovery to mend his overstretched finances.\nUPDATE 20:21\nI have had a quick word with Robert Chote of the OBR, and he says that even if he had seen October's lamentable borrowing figures he would not have changed his deficit projections.\nHis expectation is that revenues will rise for the government because of measures already taken, but which have not yet led to a higher tax yield."}

Members will submit a report to parliament, before the order is voted on by all MSPs at a later date.\nPutting forward a motion to have the committee recommend the move to parliament, Mr Mackay told its members that his plans would lead to a \"more progressive\" and \"fairer\" system of local taxation.\nMr Wightman lodged an amendment to the finance secretary's motion to \"note concerns\" about the fact the council tax base has not been updated since 1991 and recognising the recommendation of the Commission on Local Tax Reform that \"the present council tax system must end\".\nLabour's Elaine Smith backed Mr Wightman, saying the committee should \"reflect the evidence\" heard from members.\nBut SNP and Conservative members united against the amendment, with Tory Graham Simpson saying there \"isn't much point\" to adding it to the debate.\nMr Simpson also opposed Mr Mackay's original motion, saying it represented a \"fundamental change\" to the way local services are funded, and undermined local accountability.\nThe motion ultimately passed by four votes to two, with Ms Smith joining the three SNP members and Mr Wightman abstaining.\nThe committee will now compile a report on the issue for parliament, while it will be down to the parliamentary bureau to decide if there needs to be a further chamber debate on the issue as well as a vote.\nThe government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale's vote failed to register.\nOpposition members had successfully amended a government motion promoting its council tax reform strategy, changing the wording to condemn the approach as undermining local accountability.
